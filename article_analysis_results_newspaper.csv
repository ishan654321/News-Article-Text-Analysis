BBC Global Disinformation Unit, BBC News Arabic and BBC Eye Investigations
WATCH: Mona Ali Al-Karim says she and her daughters beg for money to pay for hospital treatment
Displaced families in Syrian camps are begging for donations on TikTok while the company takes up to 70% of the proceeds, a BBC investigation found.
Children are livestreaming on the social media app for hours, pleading for digital gifts with a cash value.
The BBC saw streams earning up to $1,000 (£900) an hour, but found the people in the camps received only a tiny fraction of that.
TikTok said it would take prompt action against ""exploitative begging"".
The company said this type of content was not allowed on its platform, and it said its commission from digital gifts was significantly less than 70%. But it declined to confirm the exact amount.
Earlier this year, TikTok users saw their feeds fill with livestreams of families in Syrian camps, drawing support from some viewers and concerns about scams from others.
In the camps in north-west Syria, the BBC found that the trend was being facilitated by so-called ""TikTok middlemen"", who provided families with the phones and equipment to go live.
The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok's global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.
Children are livestreaming for hours at a time begging for gifts on TikTok
Since the TikTok algorithm suggests content based on the geographic origin of a user's phone number, the middlemen said they prefer to use British SIM cards. They say people from the UK are the most generous gifters.
Mona Ali Al-Karim and her six daughters are among the families who go live on TikTok every day, sitting on the floor of their tent for hours, repeating the few English phrases they know: ""Please like, please share, please gift.""
Mona's husband was killed in an airstrike and she is using the livestreams to raise money for an operation for her daughter Sharifa, who is blind.
The gifts they're asking for are virtual, but they cost the viewers real money and can be withdrawn from the app as cash. Livestream viewers send the gifts - ranging from digital roses, costing a few cents, to virtual lions costing around $500 - to reward or tip creators for content.
For five months, the BBC followed 30 TikTok accounts broadcasting live from Syrian camps for displaced people and built a computer program to scrape information from them, showing that viewers were often donating digital gifts worth up to $1,000 an hour to each account.
Families in the camps said they were receiving only a tiny fraction of these sums, however.
With TikTok declining to say how much it takes from gifts, the BBC ran an experiment to track where the money goes.
A reporter in Syria contacted one of the TikTok-affiliated agencies saying he was living in the camps. He obtained an account and went live, while BBC staff in London sent TikTok gifts worth $106 from another account.
At the end of the livestream, the balance of the Syrian test account was $33. TikTok had taken 69% of the value of the gifts.
Keith says 50,000 people watched the TikTok live he did with a Syrian family
TikTok influencer and ex-professional rugby player Keith Mason donated £300 ($330) during one family's livestream and encouraged his nearly one million followers to do the same.
When told by the BBC that most of these funds were taken by the social media company, he said it was ""ridiculous"" and ""unfair"" to families in Syria.
""You've got to have some transparency. To me, that's very greedy. It's greed,"" he said.
The $33 remaining from the BBC's $106 gift was reduced by a further 10% when it was withdrawn from the local money transfer shop. TikTok middlemen would take 35% of the remainder, leaving a family with just $19.
Hamid, one of the TikTok middlemen in the camps, told the BBC he had sold his livestock to pay for a mobile phone, SIM card and wi-fi connection to work with families on TikTok.
He now broadcasts with 12 different families, for several hours a day.
Hamid said he uses TikTok to help families make a living. He pays them most of the profits, minus his running costs, he said.
Like the other middlemen, Hamid said he was supported by ""live agencies"" in China, who work directly with TikTok.
""They help us if we have any problems with the app. They unlock blocked accounts. We give them the name of the page, the profile picture, and they open the account,"" Hamid said.
Hamid helps families go on TikTok live. Watch how the BBC investigated TikTok's commission from digital gifts
Agencies like these, known as ""livestreaming guilds"" and based all around the world, are contracted by TikTok to help content creators produce more appealing livestreams.
TikTok pays them a commission according to the duration of livestreams and the value of gifts received, the agencies told the BBC.
The emphasis on duration means TikTokers, including children in the Syrian camps, go live for hours at a time.
Marwa Fatafta, from digital rights organisation Access Now, says these livestreams run contrary to TikTok's own policies to ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
BBC News investigates a new trend on TikTok - hundreds of families in camps for displaced people in Syria, begging for gifts on TikTok livestreams.
""TikTok clearly states that users are not allowed to explicitly solicit gifts, so this is a clear violation of their own terms of services, as well as the rights of these people,"" she said.
She acknowledges that people have the right to share their stories online ""to try to seek support and sympathy"", but she says these livestreams ""lack dignity, and are humiliating"".
TikTok's rules say you must have 1,000 followers before you can go live, you must not directly solicit for gifts and must ""prevent the harm, endangerment or exploitation"" of minors on the platform.
But when the BBC used the in-app system to report 30 accounts featuring children begging, TikTok said there had been no violation of its policies in any of the cases.
After the BBC contacted TikTok directly for comment, the company banned all of the accounts.
It said in a statement: ""We are deeply concerned by the information and allegations brought to us by the BBC, and have taken prompt and rigorous action.
""This type of content is not allowed on our platform, and we are further strengthening our global policies around exploitative begging.""
TikTok, the world's fastest-growing social media app, has made more than $6.2bn in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017, according to analytics company Sensor Tower.
The BBC approached several charities working in Syria to support families in the camps as an alternative to making money on TikTok Live.
A local charity Takaful Alsham said it would provide basic supplies to the families for the next three months, helping the children find schools and covering their educational expenses.
But for many in the camps, there are few options to make money other than begging online. Hundreds of families continue to go live every day, and most of the money donated is still going to TikTok.

BBC Access All
Of the thousands of disability hate crimes reported to the police last year, just 1% resulted in criminal charges, two charities have revealed.
Leonard Cheshire and United Response submitted Freedom of Information requests to 43 police forces in England and Wales and 36 responded.
It found that out of more than 11,000 reports, 99% of cases went no further.
The National Police Chiefs' Council said it wanted ""to understand the reasons"" behind the low number.
A hate crime is an offence which targets a victim's protected characteristics, including their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability.
PhD student, Cassie Lovelock from London, told the BBC Access All podcast she has experienced physical and verbal abuse because of her disability many times.
She has hereditary neuropathy with a liability for pressure palsies (HNPP), a rare condition with similar symptoms to MS, and often uses a wheelchair.
On one occasion, while waiting for her boyfriend outside a shop, two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair and pushed her down the road while making sexual comments.
Despite screaming for help, she claims passers-by ignored her. She eventually escaped by rolling her wheelchair into the road.
Listen to Access All on BBC Sounds
And a month into Prime Minister Liz Truss's premiership there's still no confirmation about who the new Minister of State for Disabled People will be…or is there?
On another occasion, Cassie was pushed out of her wheelchair by a woman who wanted to use the wheelchair space on a London bus for her pushchair.
""It was very humiliating,"" Cassie says. The bus driver witnessed the incident, helped Cassie and refused to let the other woman travel.
Cassie says the incidents she has endured - including being shouted at on the street and accused of faking her disability - have all been ""intrinsically tied"" to her disability.
But, she admits, she hasn't always reported her experiences immediately because she wasn't sure they would be considered hate crimes.
Ali Gunn, policy lead for United Response, which was involved in the research, says Cassie's experience is common.
""A lot of the time victims don't even know they've been a victim of a disability hate crime"" and, as a result, the number of reported incidents could be the ""tip of the iceberg"".
She says a disability hate crime is classed as ""any criminal offence that is motivated by a person's disability or perceived disability"".
Of those hate crimes that were reported but went no further, Ali says: ""We found that around 50% of the no-charge outcomes were a result of either the victim withdrawing support, evidential difficulties despite there being a named suspect, or that the police were unable to find a suspect.""
She says its ""really important for the victim to capture as much information as possible - what they hear, what they see, or what's happening and the date, the time, the location"".
But she adds that the whole community should play its part.
""If you witness a crime you might feel uncomfortable or nervous to go up at the time, but afterwards please support the victim. Give your phone number, give any information that you were able to record at that point in time about what happened.""
The two charities - Leonard Cheshire and United Response - which conducted the research have called for police forces to appoint Disability Liaison Officers.
""They would be able to support a disabled victim from the point of reporting all the way through,"" Ali says, hopefully resulting in a higher charge rate.
This week, the Home Office also released its statistics on hate crimes. It reported that 14,242 disability hate crimes had been recorded in the year ending March 2022 - an increase of 43% on the previous year.
That figure has doubled since 2017/2018 with stalking and harassment offences the most commonly recorded disability hate crimes.
A Home Office spokesperson described hate crime as a ""scourge on communities"" and said that ""while the rise is likely to be largely driven by improvements in police recording, we cannot be complacent.""
They added: ""[We] expect the police to fully investigate these hateful attacks and make sure the cowards who commit them feel the full force of the law.""
After thinking about the incident with the men, Cassie did report it to the police. She received a call from an officer and a case number, but says she never heard from them again, putting Cassie's case in the 99% that result in no charge. The force was unable to corroborate this information.
Cassie is getting on with her PhD, but says the ""terrifying"" experiences have stayed with her and she has changed where she shops and which public transport she uses as a result.
""Even now, I get this anxiety - what if something happens?"" she says.

3,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-63851215,"The seven-day-a-week life of a maid for Qatar's royal and rich
Gender and identity correspondent
Qatar's human rights record is under scrutiny as the World Cup takes place in Doha. A lot has been written about the treatment of migrant workers who built the stadiums and hotels, but much less about the foreign maids who work for Qatar's ruling classes. On paper their rights have been strengthened in recent years - but the new rules aren't always followed.
I make contact with Gladys (not her real name) late at night, after her employers from the Qatari elite have gone to bed.
In a brief online conversation she tells me she works from 8am to 11pm every day. She cleans, helps prepare food and looks after the children.
She eats what's left from the family's meals, and says she hasn't had a day off since she started 18 months ago.
""Madam is crazy,"" Gladys, a Filipina woman in her 40s, says about her employer. ""She shouts at me every day.""
Before Qatar won the competition to host the 2022 World Cup, foreign workers were unable to change jobs or leave the country without their employer's permission. It's still like this in most Gulf states.
Under scrutiny, Qatar began to introduce reforms, but Amnesty International says these have failed to end a pattern of abuses faced by domestic workers.
For example, Gladys's employer has held on to her passport, preventing her from leaving without his consent.
But Gladys still feels lucky. At least she has been allowed to keep her phone, she says, unlike some other foreign maids. Also, she is not physically abused. In Qatar, this happens all too often, she says.
There is another reason she wants to stay in her current job - she thinks it's unlikely at her age that she will get a better one. She earns 1,500 rials a month (just under £350) and is able to send it all home to support her family.
Domestic workers' rights
Joanna Concepcion of Migrante International, a grassroots organisation supporting Filipino overseas workers, says that many keep quiet about bad working conditions because earning money for their families is their overriding priority.
But when those in Gulf states do feel confident enough to talk freely, she says, they often mention serious abuse. One woman said her employer would push her head into a toilet basin and deny her food and water when he was angry.
By contrast, a maid employed by the ruling royal Al Thani family, says she is treated well - but she has no day off, as all workers now should under the new rules.
Smiley and animated, Althea (not her real name) video calls the BBC from the basement of a royal residence. She explains that her employers have given her an iPhone, clothes, jewellery and shoes of a kind she couldn't afford back home in the Philippines.
As in Gladys's case, it's the difficulty of earning a living wage at home that has brought her here.
As we speak, other Filipino domestic workers, who share a large room in Althea's living quarters, say Hi and join the call.
They have their own bedrooms and a shared kitchen. This is important. The maids Althea sees on TikTok and Facebook begging for food, and pleading for someone to rescue them, are not as fortunate.
""I see those videos online all the time, which is why I feel so lucky,"" she says. ""For me, every day feels like a fairy tale.""
Nonetheless, it's hard work in these ""Cinderella palaces"" as she refers to them, with their high ceilings and chandeliers, antiques inlaid with gold, mother-of-pearl table tops, and freshly cut flowers.
The day generally begins at 6.30am, when staff prepare breakfast for the family. Althea eats once the family has finished. After clearing away, they clean the rooms and set places for lunch.
""It is light work because there are many of us,"" Althea says.
Maids rest in their flats between 3pm and 6pm, then prepare for dinner. Once dinner is over, Althea has finished work, and is free to leave the compound if she wants.
The royal family doesn't hold on to her passport. But Althea does work every day, including weekends. She doesn't get the day off that Qatari law is now supposed to guarantee. It's a price she pays for providing her family with vital financial support.
Mary Grace Morales, a recruiter in Manila who pairs Filipino staff with VIPs in the Gulf, says working for the palace is an ""enviable"" job.
""The family is generous,"" she says. And, in a comment reflecting the hardships the maids may have faced at home, she adds: ""The girls get fatter while they are in the palace. The family feeds them well.""
Mary Grace Morales: The palace wants ""very pretty"" staff no older than 35
But the royals have some very specific requirements, she reveals.
""The girls sent to work for the Qatari royal family are between 24 and 35 and very pretty,"" Ms Morales says.
She pauses to look at the screen where I stare back at her from the BBC headquarters in London.
""Prettier than you,"" she says, smiling.
She later sends a WhatsApp to apologise, as her children overheard and said she had been rude. I assure her I was not offended - and don't mention that hiring people on the basis of their looks would be illegal in many countries.
Joanna Concepcion, of Migrante International, says she hopes Althea's account of working as a royal maid is true, but adds: ""It's unlikely that we can know that for certain while she is still in Qatar and working for such a powerful family.""
Some royal staff have complained after leaving the country. In 2019 three British and American workers - a bodyguard, personal trainer and private tutor - sued the emir's sister, Sheikha al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and her husband, in New York, alleging that they had been made to work long hours without overtime. The couple denied the allegations and settled without any admission of liability.
""Reporting and addressing cases of violence and harassment, lack of occupational safety and health, and lack of decent accommodation can be challenging,"" says International Labour Organization (ILO) regional director for Arab states, Ruba Jaradat.
The ILO says it is working with Qatar to implement the new rules guaranteeing a minimum wage, a day off each week, sick leave and overtime payments, although this remains ""a challenge"".
Althea, in her royal palace, says she is happy despite the long hours.
When she goes to bed she will message one of her siblings or parents in the Philippines. She often feels homesick - a fairytale palace is not home.
However, it remains a crucial source of income.
""I could never support my family without this job,"" she says.
The BBC asked the Qatari royal family and the Qatari embassy in London to comment, but received no reply.

4,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-60841291,"The guitarist who saved hundreds of people on a sinking cruise liner
Having worked as an entertainer on board cruise liners for many years, guitarist Moss went on to become a cruise director
When the luxury liner Oceanos started taking on water in rough seas during a voyage around the coast of South Africa in 1991, musician Moss Hills and his colleagues suddenly found themselves responsible for everyone on board.
It was during dinner that Moss Hills began to realise just how severe the storm was. The ship's waiters, normally completely adept at carrying drinks and food without spilling anything, were struggling. Moss, a guitarist from Zimbabwe working on board the cruise liner alongside his wife Tracy, a bass player, had never seen the waiters dropping trays before.
Earlier that day, gale-force winds and heavy rains had delayed sailing for the final leg of the cruise towards Durban several times. But with no sign of conditions improving, the captain eventually decided to lift anchor and the Oceanos, with 581 guests and crew on board, sailed off into 40-knot winds and 9m-high (30ft) waves.
Moss and Tracy, both in their 30s, would usually host parties up on the pool deck as the ship sailed away from port. But that day the party had been moved indoors, and Moss braced his body while he played his guitar, trying to keep his balance as the ship pitched and rolled.
""The storm just got worse and worse,"" Moss says.
At dinner, Tracy - who her husband describes as unflappable - decided to go to their cabin to organise an emergency bag, just in case.
""Off she went,"" Moss says, ""and suddenly - boom - all the lights went out.""
Tracy and Moss worked on cruise ships together for many years
When none of the ship's officers appeared to issue instructions, Moss, who was not easily frightened, began to feel uneasy.
""You're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, in the dark of night, in a terrible storm,"" he says, ""I felt this tightening in my stomach.""
When small, dim emergency lights came on, Moss went up to the lounge to check on the musical instruments on stage. Microphone and cymbal stands were strewn about. Then he suddenly realised he couldn't hear the constant, throbbing, background noise of the engines. The ship had lost power and was slowing down.
Soon the 153m (502ft) Oceanos was drifting sideways onto the crashing waves.
The ship, says Moss, was getting hammered.
Anxious guests began pouring into the lounge. Pot plants, ashtrays, and chairs were sliding around, and people had to move from their seats to sit on the floor as the ship lurched wildly from one side to the other, port to starboard.
About an hour passed, and the mood in the lounge grew tense. Moss grabbed an acoustic guitar and began singing with some of the other entertainers to try to keep people calm. But as time stretched on, Moss noticed that the ship was heeling - no longer coming back to a level position when it was being thrown about in the storm.
""Something bad is happening,"" Moss said to Tracy, ""I'm going to try and find out what's going on.""
Hear Moss tell his story in a new series of Life Changing on 6 April 2022 at 0900 on BBC Radio 4 - or listen to the podcast.
Hanging on to the handrails, Moss and another entertainer, Julian, a magician from Yorkshire, made their way through the darkness below deck. They could hear excited voices speaking many different languages. Officers were running around, some were carrying bags, some had life jackets on, and some were wet.
""Everyone was pretty wild-eyed and panicked-looking,"" Moss says. ""We were trying to ask, 'What's happening?' but it was like we didn't exist.""
Julian and Moss continued down to the engine room - the lowest part of the ship.
""We were way below the waterline, in the dark, on our own, and there was no-one there,"" Moss says. ""That would never, ever happen, even when you're docked.""
The thick, metal doors which acted as a safety barrier by preventing water moving from one compartment of a ship to another in the event of flooding, were tightly closed.
""But it sounded like there was a large body of water sloshing about behind those watertight doors,"" Moss says.
Some passengers in lifejackets sat on the floor, while others lined up for the lifeboats
Back up in the lounge, there had still not been any announcements about what was going on. Moss found the cruise director who said the captain had told her they were going to have to abandon the ship.
""Then we found out that one lifeboat had already gone with a lot of the crew and senior officers on it,"" he says.
Moss and the others had no idea how to evacuate a cruise ship, nor how to launch the lifeboats which hung high above the deck along each of the ship's sides, but there was nobody more qualified around to do it.
One by one, they began lowering the starboard side lifeboats down to the deck. They didn't know how to keep them steady as people got on, so Moss improvised by standing with one leg on the deck of the ship and the other on a lifeboat.
But each time the ship rolled to starboard, Moss would have to jump back onto the Oceanos before the lifeboat swung away, opening up a gap of a couple of metres, and then swung back, smashing with such force against the ship's hull that bits of it came splintering off.
Each heaving lifeboat, now with as many as 90 people in it, many screaming in fear, would then be lowered down to the sea on cables. But Moss had no idea how to start the engines or even where the keys were.
""We'd let them go, off into the night, and they would just drift away into the pounding waves,"" he says. ""The people in the lifeboats had a torturous time - they were getting deluged in spray, it was cold and completely dark, but we just had to carry on until all of the starboard side lifeboats were launched.""
One of the Filipino crew who had remained on board trying to lower a lifeboat hanging on the portside of the ship
By now the Oceanos was taking in more and more water and heeling markedly to its starboard side. Launching the remaining lifeboats on the port side safely was near impossible.
Instead of being lowered down to the water once loaded up with people, the lifeboats would cling to the side of the ship until the next big wave rolled in, tipping the ship enough to let them dangle freely.
""And then gravity would suddenly drop the lifeboat three or four metres (13 ft) in one go, almost tipping people out into the open water, it was horrific,"" Moss says.
Eventually, he realised it was too dangerous to continue.
""In the effort to try and rescue people we were possibly going to kill them,"" Moss says.
And time was running out.
Unable to launch any more lifeboats, but with hundreds of people still in need of rescue, Moss and others made their way up to the ship's bridge - where they assumed they would find the captain and the remaining senior officers - to ask what to do next.
""We looked inside, but there was no one there,"" Moss says. ""That's when we realised - it's just us.""
Orangey-red lights blinked in the darkness, but Moss had no idea what most of the equipment was for, never mind how it worked. They took turns trying to use the radio to send an SOS.
""I was calling, 'Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!' and just waiting for somebody to answer,"" Moss says.
A big, deep, rich voice eventually replied. ""Yes, what is your Mayday?""
Relieved, Moss explained that he was on the cruise ship Oceanos and that it was sinking.
""OK. How long have you got left to float?""
""I don't know - we've got the starboard railings in the water, we're rolling around, we've taken on a huge amount of water,"" Moss said. ""We still have at least 200 people on board.""
""OK. What is your position?""
""We're probably about halfway between the port of East London and Durban.""
""No, no, no, what are your coordinates?""
Moss had no idea what their coordinates were.
""Well, I'm not a rank - I'm a guitarist.""
""What are you doing on the bridge?""
""Well, there's nobody else here.""
""Who's on the bridge with you?""
""So I said, 'It's me, my wife - the bass player, we've got a magician here…'""
Moss was put in contact with two small ships that were close to the Oceanos. They told Moss to find the captain and get him onto the bridge. But Moss had no idea where he was.
""I knew he wouldn't be down below because we were sinking,"" he says. ""I was making regular checks to see where the water level was, and one deck below us was flooded.""
Eventually, Moss found the captain, right at the back of the ship, smoking in the darkness. Moss explained that they needed his help - urgently.
""He was just looking at me, wide-eyed and vacant, saying, 'It's not necessary, it's not necessary,'"" Moss says.
""I think he was in deep, deep shock.""
The two ships close to the Oceanos had only one lifeboat each, so there was little they could do to help. They shared the sinking vessel's coordinates with the South African authorities who began to organise an air rescue mission.
Moss and Tracy were among the last people to be airlifted to safety
As the storm continued to batter the ship, Moss and Tracy sat together in the near darkness, praying that help would arrive before it was too late.
""I think the ship is going to go down and it's very likely we're going to go down with it,"" Moss said to his wife.
He and Tracy had a 15-year-old daughter, Amber, who'd been on board the Oceanos for the holidays and disembarked just days earlier. Amber was now back at boarding school in South Africa.
""She can't lose both parents,"" Moss remembers saying. ""Whatever we do, we've got to make sure at least one of us gets off.""
As dawn broke, the first of two navy divers attempted to get down to the Oceanos in strong winds
More than three hours passed before the first rescue helicopter arrived and hovered above the ship.
Two navy divers were winched down to the Oceanos' deck. They said they needed help to get everyone off before the ship sank, and Moss was given a five-minute crash course on how to run a helicopter airlift.
""Remember, the harness needs to be quite tight under people's underarms,"" the navy diver told him. ""Make sure you get it right because otherwise they'll tip upside down and fall out - you'll kill them on the deck. Do two at a time or else we're going to run out of time. OK? Go.""
One navy diver went to organise the helicopter rescue at the rear of the ship and Tracy and Moss were to organise a second at the front. But as the ship sank ever lower beneath the waves, people began jumping off the steeply pitching deck in panic and a rigid inflatable had to be launched into the churning sea to rescue them.
Dangling in mid-air from the helicopter cable, people who Moss was trying to save were being blown against parts of the ship by the strong winds as they were winched into the sky. There was no way of knowing how badly hurt they were and Moss momentarily lost his nerve. But with so many people still on board, he realised he had no choice but to keep going.
In total, five helicopters joined the rescue mission, shuttling back and forth, carrying 12 people at a time to safety as dawn broke and the darkness lifted.
Drained and exhausted, Moss and Tracy were among the last to be strapped into harnesses.
""As we were hovering above the ship it really hit me,"" Moss says, ""I could see the Oceanos was in a critical situation. We could see waves breaking over the bow where we had been rescuing people.""
When the helicopter carrying Moss touched down on the grass, cruise passengers ran towards him singing and cheering, and reaching out to hug him.
""I started to choke up and sob,"" Moss says, ""and then I collapsed.""
Sun loungers, life jackets and other debris tumbled off the deck and floated on the surface of the water before the ship finally disappeared
On 4 August 1991, about 45 minutes after the last person on board had been airlifted to safety, the Oceanos slipped away below the water. Everyone who had been put into lifeboats was rescued by passing ships and remarkably no lives were lost.
Moss and Tracy, who now live in Liverpool, continued working as cruise ship entertainers for many years. Even now, three decades later, Tracy prefers not to talk about the sinking or dwell on how close they all came to losing their lives.
But Moss, who's been asked about the Oceanos many, many times, finds it cathartic to talk about. He looks back on what happened with great relief.
""I'm not invincible,"" Moss says, ""but if I can get through that, I can get through anything.""
There was an inquiry in Greece which found the captain of the Oceanos and four other senior officers negligent in the ship's sinking.

BBC Environment & Rural Affairs Team
Andy Pollard, pictured with his wife, spent years spraying pesticides on his land
Some British farmers are calling for a ban on the UK production of toxic weedkiller Paraquat, saying studies suggest it could be a factor in the onset of Parkinson's Disease. It comes as hundreds of US farm workers pursue a legal case against its manufacturer, alleging it knew the risk and failed to warn them.
Andy Pollard was once a farm manager who could leap into his tractor cab. But now his limbs are rigid and his body contorts with spasms. He has advanced Parkinson's Disease, and can no longer control his own movements.
He spent decades spraying herbicides on his land and, unaware of any danger, didn't use protective equipment.
""Paraquat was a really good thing to use - or so we thought,"" his wife Sue says. ""Andy would be driving around the fields and the spray would be going everywhere.""
She had thought it was a coincidence that the only people she knew with Parkinson's were farm workers, then read about the potential connection with the chemical.
""Why hasn't it been regulated and stopped?"" she asks. ""We've got a lot of people in the same situation.""
Millions of farmers have used Paraquat to kill weeds on their land
Paraquat was first manufactured in the UK in the early 1960s and is sold globally - 377 companies have registered it for sale.
It is one of the world's most popular and effective herbicides, millions of farmers have used it to kill weeds. But it is also one of the most dangerous and has caused thousands of poisoning deaths.
Its manufacturer Syngenta says claims of a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's are not supported by scientific evidence, stating it has undergone more than 1,200 safety studies.
Andy regularly visits a Dorset farm run by charity Countrymen UK, founded by Julie Plumley after her father John was diagnosed with Parkinson's.
The 30-acre working farm sells beef and lamb. In the yard, instead of tractors is a fleet of mobility scooters. ""The farmers come here not because they're ill,"" Julie explains, ""but because they want to get on with living.""
John Stockley would hand-spray the chemical in his fields
Parkinson's Disease is believed to be the world's fastest-growing neurological condition. It affects neurons in a specific area of the brain called the substantia nigra.
It is degenerative, gradually leading to tremors and stiffness in the limbs. Global studies show rural, agricultural areas often have higher rates of the disease.
Julie explains her childhood farm was owned by the local council, so her father had to meet certain conditions. ""He had to use chemicals, because if you got too many dock leaves or thistles, they could take money away from you. Paraquat was the pesticide all the farmers used.""
He would carry a backpack filled with the chemical and spend hours hand-spraying the fields. ""He would have his sleeves rolled up, his arms bare, the liquid dripping down.""
John developed the disease in his 40s and always believed there was a connection to the chemicals. His suspicion deepened when his neighbour Ken Barnes was diagnosed around the same time - he was also in his 40s and had also been using Paraquat for years.
Parkinson's has caused Ken Barnes to lose his clarity of speech
Ken now visits Julie's farm. He has a twinkle in his eye, but his clarity of speech has gone. ""It's a horrible disease,"" says his wife Sue. ""It's taken his life away.""
She says its manufacture in the UK and export should be stopped. ""I wouldn't want my son, who's got farming qualifications, ending up like his father.""
Paraquat has not been authorised for use in the EU since a court ruling in 2007. That is still the case in the UK after Brexit but it is still made - under the brand name Gramoxone - at Syngenta's plant in Huddersfield. It is exported to countries such as the US, Japan and Australia, with a fifth of exports going to the developing world.
In the US, nearly 900 farmers and field workers have joined forces to sue the manufacturer, claiming not only is there a link between Paraquat and Parkinson's, but that Syngenta has deliberately hidden the health risks from the authorities.
Syngenta rejects the claims made in the remaining multidistrict litigation case, which is due to come to court later this year.
The company's most recent financial statement shows that the company has already paid $187.5m into a settlement fund. But it said the company believes that all of these claims are without merit and the payment is simply to keep the claims from going any further.
Toxicologist Prof Jon Heylings worked for Syngenta and its predecessor companies for more than 20 years. After retiring, he turned whistleblower, and has given evidence as an expert witness in the US legal action.
He said farmers who used it without protective equipment, damaging their skin, should be worried. ""If they went out the next day and actually used it again, and the next day, you could absorb more Paraquat through the skin, into the blood and then into the brain,"" he says.
""The issue is really does it actually cause Parkinson's when it gets into the brain? That's one of the key issues around the whole exposure. And if this chemical does cause Parkinson's, who is responsible?""
There is no scientific consensus and many conflicting studies on any possible association between Paraquat and Parkinson's.
In the UK, research charity Cure Parkinson's said exposure was ""a well-recognised environmental risk factor"" but Parkinson's UK said studies show ""a small increased risk"" at most.
In the US, a 17-year-long study found Paraquat contributed to Parkinson's onset and progression. And research by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences - part of the US Department of Health - found people who used Paraquat developed Parkinson's two-and-a-half times more often than non-users.
But the US regulator, the Environmental Protection Agency, says an updated study couldn't replicate those results and no clear link was found.
Prof Jon Heylings with a strategy document written while Paraquat was still in use by UK farmers
But there are scientists who believe Syngenta is putting profit before product safety and public health.
Prof Heylings has a Syngenta regulatory strategy document from 2003 written while Paraquat was still being used by UK farmers. Its author acknowledges a growing number of studies ""citing a correlation between incidence of Parkinson's Disease and herbicide use, including Paraquat"".
He explains: ""Syngenta are trying to influence researchers who are working on Paraquat and also influence the direction of the research because the last thing Syngenta wants is a big blow up on Parkinson's. So the strategy was to downplay anything to do with the potential neurotoxicity of Paraquat that could lead to Parkinson's.""
It said: ""In our view, Jon Heylings is technically not qualified to comment on Paraquat and Parkinson's Disease. He is certainly not aware of Syngenta's research on the issue, which was mostly conducted from 2008 onwards, after he left the company. We spent tens of millions of dollars investigating Paraquat and Parkinson's disease - and this figure doesn't include the monetary value of internal expert time.""
In a statement, Syngenta said it had invested hundreds of millions of dollars over the product lifetime to ensure its safety.
""Paraquat has been the subject of more than 1,200 safety studies submitted to, and reviewed by, regulatory authorities around the world. Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities including the United States and Australia continue to support the view that Paraquat is safe.""

BBC Business
Apple has been ordered to pay Ireland €13bn (£11bn; $14bn) in unpaid taxes by Europe's top court, putting an end to an eight-year row.
The European Commission accused Ireland of giving Apple illegal tax advantages in 2016, but Ireland has consistently argued against the need for the tax to be paid.
The Irish government said it would respect the ruling.
Apple said it was disappointed with the decision and accused the European Commission of ""trying to retroactively change the rules"".
A separate European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling on Tuesday also brought a long-running case with Google to a close, with the company ordered to pay a €2.4bn (£2bn) fine for market dominance abuse.
The EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager praised both judgements. ""Today is a huge win for European citizens and tax justice,"" she said.
Back and forth
In the Apple case, the ECJ said: ""The Court of Justice gives final judgment in the matter and confirms the European Commission’s 2016 decision: Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover.""
The ruling puts an end to a lengthy back and forth legal process.
The original decision covered the period from 1991 to 2014, and related to the way in which profits generated by two Apple subsidiaries based in Ireland were treated for tax purposes.
Those tax arrangements were deemed to be illegal because other companies were not able to obtain the same advantages.
That ruling came at a time when the Commission was attempting to clamp down on multinational giants it believed were using creative financial arrangements to reduce their tax bills.
It was overturned by the lower court of the ECJ in 2020 following an appeal by Ireland.
However, that verdict has now been set aside by the higher court, which said it contained legal errors.
Apple said in a statement: ""This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal.
""The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US.
""We are disappointed with today’s decision as previously the General Court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case,"" Apple added.
The bad news for Apple comes a day after the tech giant released its new iPhone 16 range.
Why does Ireland not want the money?
The ECJ ruling means Ireland will have to recover the lost taxes from Apple – something Dublin has spent years of legal wrangling trying to avoid.
The Irish government has argued that Apple should not have to repay the back taxes, deeming that its loss was worth it to make the country an attractive home for large companies.
Ireland, which has one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the EU, is Apple's base for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
Although corporation tax rates for businesses are set nationally, and are not subject to the EU's jurisdiction, the trade bloc does have extensive powers to regulate state aid and in this case, it argued that by applying very low tax rates to Apple, Ireland was granting it an unfair subsidy.
The latest decision is a colossal victory for the European Commission in its attempts to stop big companies bending the rules.
The Irish government said the issue in the Apple case was ""now of historical relevance only"" and said the process of transferring assets to Ireland would now begin.
Tove Maria Ryding from the European Network on Debt and Development, an association of trade unions and non-governmental organisations, welcomed the ECJ's decision but stressed ""our tax problem is more than just one rotten apple"".
She said the case addressed tax matters dating back over 20 years and was ""a perfect illustration of the chaotic corporate tax system we have"".
“What we urgently need is a fundamental reform that can give us a tax system that is fair, effective, transparent and predictable,"" she said.
An expensive day for tech giants
Europe's top court has also ruled that Google must pay a €2.4bn fine for abusing the market dominance of its shopping comparison service.
The tech giant had been appealing against the fine, which was originally levied by the European Commission in 2017.
Google said it was disappointed with the ruling, and pointed out it had made changes in 2017 to comply with the Commission's decision.
At the time it was the largest penalty the Commission had ever levied - though a year later it issued Google with an even bigger fine of €4.3bn over claims it used Android software to unfairly promote its own apps.",443.0,13.424242424242424,0.06957027760599191,0.4106162818662818,12.53,127.0,3.8484848484848486,48.74,12.0,13.9,10.39,12.6,8.53,13.6,46.9,14.0,57.48,2.036117381489842,6.1512415349887135,0.6139954853273137

SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission blasts off
Billionaire Jared Isaacman has taken off in a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket for what he hopes will be the first ever privately funded spacewalk.
The mission, called Polaris Dawn, is the first of three funded by the founder of payments processing business Shift4.
He is onboard as commander alongside his close friend Scott 'Kidd' Poteet, who is a retired air force pilot, and two SpaceX engineers Anna Menon and Sarah Gillis.
The spacecraft, called Resilience, will go into an orbit that will eventually take them up to 870 miles (1,400km) above the planet. No human has been that far since Nasa's Apollo programme ended in the 1970s.
The astronauts will pass through a region of space known as the Van Allen belt, which has high levels of radiation, but the crew will be protected by the spacecraft and their newly upgraded spacesuits.
A few passes of the belt will expose them to the equivalent of three months of the radiation astronauts experience on the International Space Station, which is within acceptable limits. They aim to study the effects that a relatively short but safe exposure has on the human body.
The crew will spend their second day in space at their maximum altitude, conducting up to 40 experiments, including intersatellite laser communication between the Dragon Spacecraft and Space X’s Starlink satellite constellation.
If all goes to plan, on day three into the mission, Mr Isaacman and Sarah Gillis are expected to attempt the first ever privately funded spacewalk, which is scheduled to last two hours.
This will be while they are 700km in orbit. The astronauts will be testing new extravehicular activity (EVA) astronaut suits which, as their name suggests, have been upgraded from Space X’s intravehicular activity (IVA) suits for working outside of spacecraft.
The EVA suit incorporates a heads-up display in its helmet, which provides information about the suit while it is being used. The EVA suits are said to be comfortable and flexible enough to be worn during launch and landing, eliminating the need to have separate IVA suits.
In an interview given while she was training for the spacewalk Ms Gillis said that it was a necessary part of Space X’s plans to send people to other worlds.
“So far only countries have been able to perform a spacewalk. Space X has huge ambitions to get to Mars and make life multiplanetary. In order to get there, we need to start somewhere. And the first step is testing out the first iteration of the EVA spacesuit so that we can make spacewalks and future suit designs even better.”
It was a sentiment echoed by Mr Isaacman.
“Space X know they need EVA capability if they are going to realise their long-term dream of populating another planet someday.""
The aim is to make spacesuits less of a tailor-made garment, more able to accommodate a wider range of commercial astronaut shapes and sizes in order to reduce costs as human spaceflight becomes more commonplace.
Left-to-right, Anna Menon, Scot Poteet, billionaire Jared Isaacman and Sarah Gillis make up the private sector crew of the Polaris Dawn mission
A unique aspect of the spacewalk is that the Dragon spacecraft, called Resilience, does not have an airlock, which is a sealed room between the doorway into the vacuum outside and the rest of the spacecraft.
Normally the airlock is depressurised before the astronauts step in and out, but in the case of Resilience, the entire craft will have to be depressurised and the non-spacewalking astronauts will have to be fully suited up.
The spacecraft has been adapted to withstand the vacuum. Extra nitrogen and oxygen tanks have been installed and all four astronauts will wear EVA suits, although only two will exit the spacecraft. The mission will therefore break the record for the most people in the vacuum of space at once.
The flight team has taken the challenge as an opportunity to do tests on the impact of decompression sickness, also known as the “bends” and the blurry vision astronauts can sometimes experience in space called spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome.
Tests on the impact of radiation from the Van Allen belts as well as the spacewalk are intended to lay the ground for further high-altitude missions by the private sector possibly to the Moon or Mars.
The astronauts will be testing new extravehicular activity (EVA) astronaut suits
There are an awful lot of firsts for the rookie crew to achieve. Isaacman has been in space only once before and the other three have never flown in space.
“There’s a feeling that there are a great many risks here,” according to Dr Adam Baker, a rocket propulsion specialist at Cranfield University.
“They have set themselves a lot of ambitious objectives and they have relatively limited spaceflight experience.”
“But in counter to that, they have spent several thousand hours simulating the mission. So, they are doing their best to mitigate the risks.”
If the mission is a success, some analysts believe that it will be the start of an explosion of ever greater and cheaper private sector missions taking more people further than government space agencies have.
But Dr Baker takes a more cautious approach.
“The record so far has been a huge amount of money spent by the private sector, lots of dribs and drabs of publicity, but much less than 100 additional people on top of the 500 or so government-funded astronauts travelling to space and back, and many of those only for very brief periods.
“Spaceflight is difficult, expensive and dangerous, so expecting to see large numbers of even just well-off members of the population, as opposed to the ultra-rich, flying into space soon, or expecting you might be among them, is unlikely.”
The Dragon spacecraft has no airlock so has had to be modified to withstand the vacuum of space
Some find the idea of billionaires paying for themselves to go into space distasteful, and some eyebrows are being raised over a mission where the person paying for the trip is also the commander.
But this shouldn't be brushed off as a vanity project, according to Dr Simeon Barber, a space scientist at the Open University, who develops scientific instruments on spacecrafts, almost entirely for government-funded projects.
“Isaacman is actually the most experienced astronaut of the crew – he alone has been to space before, on another self-funded mission with SpaceX, where he also took the position of Commander. In the context of the mission, he is the natural choice,” he told BBC News.
“More widely, the proceeds from selling this stellar class ticket to ride will remain on Earth – the money will buy materials and services, it will pay salaries and in turn will generate taxes. Not to mention the charitable funds the mission will raise.”
He says that many in the space sector believe the involvement of wealthy individuals to be a good thing.
“If they wish to venture off-planet, and one day to the Moon or even Mars, then that will create opportunities to do science along the way. And the more diverse the reasons there are to explore space, the more resilient the programme becomes.”",611.0,14.209302325581396,0.13447887033601322,0.4543656977942692,13.66,144.0,3.3488372093023258,46.0,13.1,13.4,10.97,14.4,8.59,15.25,50.47,14.0,87.61,2.0130932896890346,6.423895253682487,0.6530278232405892

Editor, Technology of Business
The National Ignition Facility in California uses powerful lasers to spark fusion reactions
Deep under the Nevada desert in the 1980s the US conducted secret nuclear weapons research.
Among the experiments was an effort to see if nuclear fusion, the reaction which powers the sun, could be sparked on earth in a controlled setting.
The experiments were classified, but it was widely known among physicists that the results had been promising.
That knowledge caught the attention of two young graduate students working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the late 2000s, Conner Galloway and Alexander Valys.
The Los Alamos lab was originally set up in 1943 as a top-secret site to develop the first nuclear weapons. Located near Santa Fe, New Mexico it is now a US government research and development facility.
""When Alex and I learned about those tests at Los Alamos, our reaction was like 'wow, inertial fusion has already worked!'. Laboratory-scale pellets were ignited, the details were classified, but enough was made public that we knew that ignition was achieved,"" says Mr Galloway.
Nuclear fusion is the process of fusing hydrogen nuclei together, which produces immense amounts of energy. The reaction creates helium and not the long-lived radioactive waste of the fission process which is used in existing nuclear power stations.
If fusion can be harnessed, then it promises abundant electricity, generated without producing CO2.
Those tests in the 1980s led to the US government building the National Ignition Facility (NIF) in California, a project to see if nuclear fuel pellets could be ignited using a powerful laser.
After more than a decade of work, in late 2022 researchers at NIF made a breakthrough. Scientists conducted the first controlled fusion experiment to produce more energy from the reaction than that supplied by the lasers which sparked it.
While physicists around the world marvelled at that breakthrough, it had taken the scientists at NIF much longer than expected.
""They were energy starved,"" says Mr Galloway.
He doesn't mean they needed more snacks, instead the NIF laser was only just powerful enough to ignite the fuel pellet.
Mr Galloway and Mr Valys think that more powerful lasers will make it possible to build a working fusion reaction that can supply electricity to the power grid. To do that they founded Xcimer, based in Denver.
NIF had to make do with a laser that could pump out two megajoules of energy. Mr Galloway and Mr Valys are planning to experiment with lasers that can supply up to 20 megajoules of energy.
""We think 10 to 12 [megajoules] is the sweet spot for a commercial power plant,"" says Mr Galloway.
Such a laser beam would hit the fuel capsule with a powerful punch. It would be like taking the energy of a 40-tonne articulated lorry travelling at 60mph and focussing it on the centimetre-sized capsule for a few billionths of a second.
More powerful lasers will allow Xcimer to use larger and simpler fuel capsules than NIF, which found it difficult to perfect them.
Conner Galloway (left) and Alexander Valys founders of fusion firm Xcimer
Xcimer joins dozens of other organisations around the world trying to build a working fusion reactor.
There are two main approaches. Smashing a fuel pellet with lasers falls under the category of inertial confinement fusion.
The other way, known as magnetic confinement fusion, uses powerful magnets to trap a burning cloud of atoms called plasma.
Both approaches have daunting engineering challenges to overcome.
In particular, how do you extract the heat generated during fusion so you can do something useful with it, like drive a turbine to make electricity?
""I suppose my scepticism is, I haven't yet even seen a persuasive conceptual diagram of how you manage the process of taking energy out while keeping the fusion reaction going,"" says Prof Ian Lowe at Griffith University in Australia.
He has spent his long career working in energy research and policy.  While Prof Lowe supports the development of fusion technology, he just argues that a working fusion reactor won't come fast enough to help bring down CO2 emissions and tackle climate change.
""My concern is that even the most optimistic view is that we'd be lucky to have commercial fusion reactors by 2050. And long before then we need to have decarbonized the energy supply if we're not going to melt the planet,"" he says.
Another challenge is that the fusion reaction produces high energy particles that will degrade steel, or any other material that lines the reactor core.
Secret fusion tests were conducted at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the 1980s
Those in the fusion industry don't deny the engineering challenges, but feel they can be overcome.
Xcimer plans to use a ""waterfall"" of molten salt flowing around the fusion reaction to absorb the heat.
The founders are confident that they can fire the lasers and replace the fuel capsules (one every two seconds) while keeping that flow going.
The flow of molten salt will also be thick enough to absorb high energy particles that could potentially damage the reactor.
""We just have two relatively small laser beams coming in from either side [of the fuel pellet]. So you only need a gap in the flow big enough for those beams, and so you don't have to turn off and turn on the entire flow,"" says Mr Valys.
But how quickly can them make such a system work?
Xcimer plans to experiment with the lasers for two years, before building a target chamber, where they can target the fuel pellets.
The final stage would be the working reactor, which they hope would be plugged into the electricity grid in the mid-2030s.
To fund the first phase of their work, Xcimer has raised $100m (£77m) . The money will be used to build a facility in Denver and the prototype laser system.
Hundreds of millions dollars more will be needed to build a working reactor.
But for the founders of Xcimer, and other fusion start-ups, the prospect of cheap, carbon-free electricity is irresistible.
""You know, it'll change the trajectory of what's possible for humanity's progress,"" says Mr Valys.",576.0,11.076923076923077,0.1028711816964829,0.554951016185956,11.1,170.0,3.269230769230769,51.28,11.1,13.5,10.85,12.0,8.14,14.8,45.92,11.0,75.73,2.0677083333333335,6.291666666666667,0.5642361111111112

Young children seem to perceive time differently from adults (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)
Children's perception of time is relatively understudied. Learning to see time through their eyes may be fundamental to a happier human experience.
My household is absorbed in debate over when time goes the fastest or slowest.
""Slowest in the car!"" yells my son.
""Never!"" replies my daughter. ""I'm too busy for time to go slow, but maybe on weekends when we are on the sofa watching movies.""
There's some consensus too; they both agree that the days after Christmas and their birthdays dawdle by gloomily as it dawns on them they have to wait another 365 days to celebrate once more. Years seem to drag on endlessly at their age.
It's a feeling I remember well; the summer holidays filled with water play, skipping on the freshly cut lawn, the laundry drying on the washing line whilst the Sun blazed. At moments like that, time really did feel like it moved slowly.
Teresa McCormack, a professor of psychology who studies cognitive development at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland, believes children and time is a hugely understudied topic. Her work has long probed whether there is something fundamentally different about time processes in children, such as an internal clock that functions at a different speed to that of adults. But there are still more questions than answers.
""It's strange that we don't still really know the answers to questions like when do children have a proper distinction between the past and the future, given that this seems to structure the entire way that we think about our lives as adults,"" says McCormack. She explains that whilst we don't have a clear understanding of when children grasp a sense of linear time, we do know that from relatively early on in development, children seem to be sensitive to routine events such as meal times and bed times. She stresses this is not the same as having an adult sense of linear time.
In contrast to children, adults have the capacity to think of points in time independently to when an event takes place, owing to their knowledge of the conventional clock and calendar system. Semantics also play a part. ""It takes time for children to actually become completely competent users of temporal language, using terms like before, after, tomorrow and yesterday,"" says McCormack. (Read about how our language affects our sense of time and space.)
McCormack adds that our understanding of passages of time are also based on when people are asked to make those time judgements. ""Are you asking the question while events are happening or retrospectively?"" She gives an example that many will relate to. ""The time from when my child was born to when they left home now seems as if it went in the blink of an eye. But during the time when you're actually engaged in the business of child rearing, a single day lasts an eternity.""
The ability to link duration to the speed with which time passes develops later in childhood (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)
Studies have found that judging the duration and the speed of a passage of time develop separately in humans. Younger children below the age of six seem able to grasp how quickly a lesson passes in a classroom, for example, but their judgement is linked more to their emotional state than the actual duration. These two elements come together at a later stage when children understand the link between speed and duration.
Much research focuses on how our experience of the passage of time depends on how our brain stores memories and captures experiences. This is something that has long fascinated Zoltán Nádasdy, associate professor of psychology at the Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.
As an undergraduate student at the University of Budapest in 1987, Nádasdy convinced his fellow students to undertake a field study on time perception amongst children and adults. He wanted to understand why time appears to dilate when there's an accident, for example. The experiment was simple. They showed groups of children and adults two videos, both one minute long and asked them which video felt the longest and which felt the shortest.
Fast forward over three decades, and Nádasdy and his team decided to repeat the experiment. An action-packed cops-and-robbers clip and a comparatively uneventful video of people rowing on a river were shown to three age groups before they were asked to rate the duration using hand gestures. The outcome was the same. ""The four- to five-year-olds found the action-packed video longer and the boring one shorter. For the majority of grown-ups it was the opposite.""
They used hand gestures to understand if participants perceived time as a horizontal flow, something that was evident in all three age groups.
What the experiment shows, says Nádasdy, is that in the absence of a sensory organ to predict time, humans use other approximations.
""Our explicit sensory experience of the time is always indirect, which means that we need to reach for something that we think correlates with time,"" he says. ""And in psychology this is called heuristics. So, for kids what can they reach out to? How much they can talk about it.""
That proxy tends to change once children go to school, a place where they begin to learn about the concepts of simultaneity and absolute time. ""It doesn't give us the sensation of time, but it just replaces those heuristics with another one. When you go to school you are on a schedule. Your day is totally controlled.""
McCormack raises two additional factors at play when it comes to children's concept of time. ""One is that their control processes are not the same as adults,"" she says. ""They can be more impatient and find it more difficult to wait,"" she says. ""It can also be related to their attentional processes as well. The more attention that you pay to a period of time passing, the slower it seems to go for you.""
Research by Sylvie Droit-Volet, professor of psychology at the Université Clermont Auvergne in France, and John Wearden, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Keele in the UK, found that the same applies in adults. They discovered that a person's experience of time passages in daily life does not fluctuate with age, but with their emotional state. Put simply – if you are happier, time passes faster. If you are sad, time drags.
A key example of this was seen during lockdown, when researchers found a slowing of the passage of time associated with being more stressed, having fewer things to do and being older.
There's also a degree of physical deterioration as we age that might also affect our judgement of time, according to Adrian Bejan, a professor of mechanical engineering at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. He has tried to explain the puzzle of our perception of time through the lens of a theory he developed in 1996 on the ""physics of life"" that has become known as ""constructal law"".
""The biggest source of input to our brain is through vision, from the retina to the brain,"" says Bejan. ""Through the optical nerve the brain receives snapshots, like the frames of a movie. The brain develops in infancy and is used to receiving lots of these screenshots. In adulthood the body is much bigger. The travel distance between the retina and the brain has doubled in size, the pathways of transmission have become more complex with more branches. And in addition with age, we experience degradation.""
This, he says, means the rate at which we receive ""mental images"" from the stimuli of our sensory organs decreases with age. This creates the sensation of compressed time in our minds as we are receiving few mental images in one unit of clock time as adults compared with when we are children.
Our senses can also alter the way we perceive time – such as when we are presented with more visual information (Credit: Edouard Taufenbach and Bastien Pourtout)
Studies into age-related neurodegenerative changes suggest there may well be an association between optic nerve decline and a slowing in the speed at which information is processed and working memory capacity. But more work needs to be done to understand this fully.
What you are looking at can matter too. Time perception can be impacted by the properties of what is being observed – the size of the scene, how easy it is to remember and how cluttered it is. A recent by psychologists at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, found that the first two factors dilate time whereas clutter and how busy a scene is contracts it.
Something else happens for many of us as we get older – a less fluid and more inflexible routine kicks in. Research has found that the more time pressure, boredom and routine in a person's life, as well as the more future-orientated an individual is in contrast to living in the moment, the faster time is experienced.
What you are doing in the present is unsurprisingly paramount to our understanding of time, no matter our age. As our mental workload increases, for example, we tend to experience a shortening of time as we underestimate the duration of a task the more demanding it is.
Take a fun-filled two-week summer camp – it may be more memorable than your entire school year. Nádasdy explains that it is highly likely that those summer camp memories would occupy a much larger piece of brain tissue, because of the sheer number of adventures that took place during that short period.
""It's possible that people's judgments about what actually happened during a particular time period in part reflects their memory for the amount of novel things that they remember happening,"" says McCormack. ""For example, if you're an older adult, there might not have been very many big life changes that have happened for you over the last 10 years."" But when there are, those will stick in your memory just as much as that summer camp.
Bejan has some other less exertive ideas too.
""Slow it down a little more, force yourself to do new things to get away from the routine,"" he says. ""Treat yourself to surprises. Do unusual things. Have you heard a good joke? Tell me! Do you have a new idea? Do something. Make something. Say something.""

As the final season of the HBO adaptation of Elena Ferrante's Neapolitan novels begins this week, why has the show not received the plaudits – and the viewership – it deserves?
Few novels have inspired as much devotion in recent years as those of the Italian writer, Elena Ferrante – specifically, the author's Neapolitan quartet, which follows the lives of two childhood friends across six decades and four books, turning the intimate into an epic.
Originally published between 2011 and 2015, the four books sparked ""Ferrante fever"", with millions of readers all over the world falling under the spell of Elena (also known as Lenù) and her ""dazzling, terrible"" friend Lila. Ferrante – whose identity famously remains a mystery – tackles themes of friendship, desire, motherhood, misogyny, ambition, class and violence, all in unsparing detail, and against the backdrop of a changing Italy. This summer, the first book in the series, My Brilliant Friend, was voted the best book of the 21st Century in a poll by The New York Times, which described it as an ""uncompromising, unforgettable novel"".
By comparison, the TV adaptation of My Brilliant Friend has flown slightly under the radar. The show, which first aired in 2018 and starts its fourth and final season this week, hasn't attracted the same column inches as other HBO dramas (the network co-produce the series with Italian broadcaster Rai), despite its much-loved source material, cinematic production values and epic scope. It has not swept awards shows, and is often missing from round-ups of the best prestige television (it failed to make the cut of BBC Culture's own greatest TV series of the 21st Century poll in 2021).
Despite its much-loved source material, the TV adaptation of My Brilliant Friend hasn't attracted a comparable amount of attention (Credit: HBO)
Yet, much as those who love Ferrante's books do so feverishly, the show has amassed an equally devout army of fans. ""Why is it not widely acknowledged to be the best show on TV?"" asked author and journalist Taffy Brodesser-Akner on X recently, echoing the sentiments of many who believe it to be criminally underrated. It brings Ferrante's world to life brilliantly and is as complex, gripping and immersive as the novels, while also being one of the best-looking series on television.
When the news first broke that there was to be a TV adaptation of Ferrante's Neapolitan novels, expectations were high – but so was trepidation. Here were books loved for their interiority, their emotional nuance, for how deeply they explored complicated feelings. Language is integral to the books: when the two young girls secure a copy of Louisa May Alcott's Little Women early in the first novel, it sparks a realisation that education and books could be a way out for them. How would a story so deeply attached to the power of the written word translate to the television?
Series creator Saverio Costanzo, who directed the first two seasons and remains co-writer and executive producer on the rest, knew all too well how difficult it was to bring beloved books to the screen. His 2010 film The Solitude of Prime Numbers was based on a novel by Paolo Giordano, which won Italy's prestigious Strega Prize. ""It wasn't very successful because my point of view of the book was different to the majority of the readers of the book,"" he tells the BBC. ""So I promised myself not to adapt another bestseller.""
Coincidentally, a few years before that, he had attempted to adapt Ferrante's novel The Lost Daughter. Ferrante granted him the rights temporarily, giving him six months to try and produce a script – but Costanzo couldn't find a way to make the story, which is told partly in flashbacks, work (Maggie Gyllenhaal would later go on to turn the book into a film starring Olivia Colman).
Years later, out of the blue, Costanzo was in his kitchen when he got a call from Ferrante's publishers about a new project: turning My Brilliant Friend and the rest of her Neapolitan novels into a television series. Despite his reservations about working with well-known source material, it was too good an opportunity to turn down. ""I reread the books from the beginning and I felt so much into them,"" he says. ""I felt as a reader the same as so many readers around the world.""
Like many, Costanzo connected to how deeply Ferrante explored friendship, refusing to sentimentalise it, but showing how complicated, competitive and even cruel those bonds can be – and how much they shape our lives. ""Friendship is the most free relationship that we experience in our life,"" says Costanzo. ""It's a relationship made out of nothing, just will. It's pure and yet also dangerous. To carry on a friendship for a lifetime is a full-time job, because you have to deal with your weakest parts, with envy, with love, but also with hate. There are no rules in friendship.""
The novels – and TV series – focus on the friendship between Elena ""Lenù"" Greco, the books' narrator, and Raffaella ""Lila"" Cerullo (Credit: HBO)
With the friendship between Elena ""Lenù"" Greco, the books' narrator, and Raffaella ""Lila"" Cerullo, the beating heart of the story, finding the right actresses for the roles was vital. The audition process was lengthy, with Costanzo and his team seeing over 9000 potentials over eight months.
""The characters were so clear in Ferrante's writing, that you couldn't miss them,"" says Costanzo. ""Once I was looking for them, I was like, I know if I meet Lila or Elena, I will recognise them.""
He found them in Elisa Del Genio and Ludovica Nasti, who played the girls as young children, then in Margherita Mazzucco and Gaia Girace, who took over after two episodes. Mazzucco and Girace stayed until the end of season three, playing the women into their 30s, despite still being teenagers themselves.
In this new season, new faces step into the roles – Alba Rohrwacher (sister of film director Alice Rohrwacher – who directed two episodes in season two) as Elena, and Irene Maiorino (previously in Gomorrah) as Lila. Maiorino bears a striking resemblance to her predecessor Girace. Rohrwacher less so to Mazzucco – but viewers will certainly recognise her voice, as she has been the narrator of the show since the start. Besides the two women, the series has a gigantic cast of supporting characters. Many of these have also been recast throughout the seasons – but physical similarities weren't the guiding factor. ""Sometimes we were lucky,"" says Costanzo. ""Sometimes we went just for the soul of the character.""
The personal is the political
Just as crucial as the casting was bringing to life the Naples neighbourhood in which the girls grow up. ""The neighbourhood is a character as much as Elena and Lila,"" says Costanzo. ""We wanted to show through the evolution of it the way Italy has changed.""
It's widely believed Ferrante based the neighbourhood in her book on the real-life area of Rione Luzzatti, a working-class district to the east of the city centre that has now become an unlikely tourist spot, thanks to Ferrante fans. In the show, the neighbourhood is an elaborately constructed set - one of the biggest ever created in Europe. Built on the site of an abandoned glass factory, 45 minutes outside of Naples, it covers 215,000 sq ft (19,974 sq m) and, just as it would have in real life, it has changed throughout the seasons. In the first, it feels claustrophobic, grey and insular. When Elena and Lila are children, it is their entire universe, so much so that they don't even see the sea until they are older. ""In the 1950s it was a disconnected neighbourhood outside of the city,"" says Costanzo. ""And then slowly people start to build and the city becomes closer and closer to the neighbourhood.""
The series follows the trajectory of Italy over the course of many decades, along with the lives of the two girls (Credit: HBO)
It's a neighbourhood marked by poverty, violence and organised crime (this isn't a story explicitly about the Mafia, but their presence is often felt). As the women get older, their world gradually opens up – though for one more than the other – but the neighbourhood continues to shape their lives.
In My Brilliant Friend, the personal is the political, and the trajectory of the girls' lives is entwined with that of Italy as a nation. Events such as the economic boom and student protests of the 1960s, the bloody battle between the communist and fascist movements, radical feminism, the legalisation of divorce, and – in the new season – widespread government corruption, all feed into Lenù and Lila's experiences. ""The political background behind the story of Lila and Elena, it is the real engine,"" says Costanzo.
My Brilliant Friend was the first foreign-language series to ever premiere on HBO. The show isn't just in Italian – there are large chunks in Neapolitan dialect, meaning even viewers in Italy need subtitles. The intricacies of speech are important. Neapolitan is the language of the neighbourhood, while Italian represents a life beyond it. Of course, these subtle shifts will be lost on many viewers, especially outside of Italy, but a refusal to round off the edges of Ferrante's story is what has made this adaptation so successful. ""Never, not even in a moment, have I used any kind of trick to make things easier for viewers,"" says Costanzo.
Ferrante worked with Costanzo on the script, communicating only over email. He has previously described the process as like ""working with a ghost"". But while she gave feedback and notes, she also gave him the freedom to pursue his vision for the show – something he's passed on to the other directors who've taken up the mantle from him – Daniele Luchetti in season three and now Laura Bispuri in season four. ""I told them, do your job, do your point of view,"" says Costanzo. ""I want them to feel as free as I was.""
This final season – based on Ferrante's fourth book, The Story of the Lost Child – sees things come full circle, with Lenù and Lila brought back together in Naples after years apart. It's now the 1980s, and decades of political and social unrest are coming to a close, but not before a succession of events again throw the women's lives and friendship into turmoil once more.
For those enthralled with My Brilliant Friend, it will be difficult to say goodbye to these characters. Its creators feel the same, too. ""I loved this project so much that I was ready to give 10 years of my life,"" says Costanzo. Meanwhile, anyone who is yet to discover this spellbinding show has something very special waiting for them.

Music Correspondent
Beyoncé in the 2016 video for Hold Up
From the moment she blew bubblegum in Crazy In Love to the day she destroyed a fleet of cars with a baseball bat in Hold Up, Beyoncé has created some of pop's most memorable music videos.
Her mastery of the medium matched that of Madonna and Michael Jackson in the 1980s - with the videos for her Lemonade album acting as a powerful celebration of black womanhood and female power.
Then, all of a sudden, she stopped. Her last two albums, Renaissance and Cowboy Carter, have been bereft of visuals, leaving fans perplexed.
Now, Beyoncé has explained her decision in a rare interview with GQ magazine, saying she didn't want her videos to become a ""distraction from the quality of the voice and the music"".
""I thought it was important that during a time where all we see is visuals, that the world can focus on the voice,"" the star said.
She explained that her recent records - which seek to contextualise black musicians'  often overlooked contributions to genres like house, disco and country - needed to stand on their own.
""The music is so rich in history and instrumentation. It takes months to digest, research, and understand,"" she said.
""The music needed space to breathe on its own.""
She added that, for Renaissance in particular, the live concert experience was more important than filming music videos.
The album, released in 2022, was written during the pandemic and was conceived as ""a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world"". The subsequent tour, and the tour film released in cinemas last year, was intended as a moment of community and catharsis for her followers.
""The fans from all over the world became the visual,"" Beyoncé told GQ.
""We all got the visual on tour.""
The Renaissance World Tour rivalled Taylor Swift as the biggest box office draw of 2023
The interview, which took place to promote the star's new whiskey brand, is the first time Beyoncé has spoken at length about her career since a joint interview with her sister Solange in 2017.
She largely withdrew from interviews around 2013-2014, opting instead to write personal essays for publications like Vogue, or addressing fans directly on social media.
The GQ article did not reveal a great deal about the notoriously private star.
She revealed that she gave up meat (except turkey) over the summer, and briefly addressed the threat of artificial intelligence, saying she recently heard an AI-generated track ""that sounded so much like me it scared me"".
Beyoncé's interview with GQ was one of her first full-length interviews in a decade
The star also talked about her efforts to shield her family from the press.
""One thing I’ve worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn’t turned into a brand.
""It’s very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art. I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.""
Award show snub
The article was published a day after it was revealed that Beyoncé had been snubbed by the Country Music Awards, with Cowboy Carter failing to land a single nomination at the genre’s most prestigious ceremony.
Her music was overlooked despite it becoming the first album by a black woman to reach number one on the US country albums chart, and the song Texas Hold 'Em spending two weeks at the top of the country singles chart.
With the interview taking place before the CMA nominations were announced, Beyoncé is simply quoted as saying she was ""hyped"" to see her country experiment  ""gain worldwide acceptance"".
However, the singer's father and former manager, Matthew Knowles, criticised the award show organisers, saying the decision to overlook Cowboy Carter ""speaks for itself"".
Talking to TMZ, he said: ""There’s more white people in America and unfortunately they don’t vote based on ability and achievements, it’s still sometimes a white and black thing.""
Five of Beyoncé's best videos
1) Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)
Sometimes the simplest ideas are the best. This black and white clip, directed by Jake Nava, simply features Beyoncé, a plain background and some Bob Fosse-inspired choreography.

2) Formation
Her most powerful and pointed video, summing up decades of black American history and culture. Set in New Orleans, it references slave plantations, segregation, Hurricane Katrina and police brutality, while simultaneously celebrating southern culture - from Mardi Gras and step-dancing to black cowboys and marching bands.
A document of resilience, it was the first chapter in the star's ongoing attempts to preserve and re-contextualise black American history.

3) Countdown
A kaleidoscope of colour and pop culture references, Beyoncé co-directed this video while very pregnant with her first daughter, Blue Ivy.
It references to Audrey Hepburn and British supermodel Twiggy, and the frenetic editing and jitterbug choreography make it a unique entry in her videography.

4) Crazy In Love
The video that launched her solo career, Crazy In Love ticks off all of the early 2000s music video clichés - fur coats, exploding cars, big hair and bullet time sequences.
But what it really does is inform the viewer that Beyoncé is a star. The camera loves her from the moment she struts towards the centre of the frame. As soon as this clip dropped, Destiny's Child must have known their days were numbered.

5) Get Me Bodied (Extended Version)
We nearly put Hold Up in fifth place. The image of Beyoncé brandishing that baseball bat has been copied and parodied a million times, but never bettered.
In the end, though, we couldn't resist the fun factor of Get Me Bodied - a big Hollywood production, with choreography inspired by Bob Fosse's Sweet Charity, and cameos from Kelly Rowland, Michelle Williams and Solange Knowles.
Like Crazy In Love, it harks back to a time when Beyoncé's only goal was pop domination - but it's still a feast for the eyes.

Tourism is relatively new in Georgia – and the country is actively seeking visitors (Credit: Getty Images)
Following this summer's heated protests against overtourism, there's some good news. For every overcrowded tourist spot in Europe, there are plenty of places around the world that need more visitors.
St Mark's Square in Venice might host more tourists than pigeons, Barcelona has seen aggression against tourists reach a fever pitch and the clifftop paths can in Italy's Cinque Terre can feel like a supermarket queue. However, beyond these (and other) hotspots lie places that are equally rich in culture but without the crowds. Around the world, there are cities crying out for tourists and walking trails where you won't see a soul all day.
While we often hear about the destructive forces of tourism in major cultural destinations, for lesser-developed countries, the money tourism brings in helps to build much-needed infrastructure and community spaces. It offers jobs and training and gives locals a chance to proudly share their country's culture and traditions. Managed well, tourism can be an enriching economic stream, bringing people together around shared values and experiences. It doesn't have to replicate the issues we've seen this summer.
THOUGHTFUL TRAVEL
Want to travel better? Thoughtful Travel is a series on the ways people behave while away, from ethics to etiquette and more.
These four destinations are just a handful of the countries who are using tourism as a tool to build stronger economies, and welcoming travellers with open arms.
Greenland
With a new international airport opening in the capital, Nuuk, later this year, plus another international landing strip coming in the northern tourist capital of Ilulissat in 2026, Greenland is getting ready to welcome an increasing number of visitors. It marks a turning point in Greenlandic tourism: to date, its international runways have not been long enough to handle large flights, instead routing travellers through Kangerlussuaq, a former US military base, and shuttling them on a smaller plane to onward destinations.
The new infrastructure will mean that not only can more tourists fly directly into the capital, but, perhaps more importantly in a country where much is imported, more goods can come in and larger quantities of its export products, including seafood, can go out, hopefully leading to an economic boost for the whole country. Tourism is one way to pay for the airport development as well as provide jobs and stability for the future.

Greenland is focused on two main forms of tourism, the first being adventure tourism, which includes everything from rock climbing in Eastern Greenland to whale watching and camping on the Greenland Ice Sheet. The other is year-round tourism, which includes an emphasis on dark sky tourism – star gazing and northern lights-watching in particular.
Getting tourists to experience Greenland in summer has been far easier than doing so in winter; but to enable local people to have year-round jobs, tourists need to come in the off season too. Attracting people to places where the sun barely shines in the peak of winter – and where temperatures can dip to -50C – might seem like a challenge, but the country has made a virtue of it, opening up sky view cabins and igloos for awe-filled aurora-focused experiences.
Tanny Por, head of international relations at Visit Greenland, is keen to emphasise that it's not a question of quantity over quality, noting that the country's goal is that 80% of the population sees tourism as something that offers a positive contribution to society. ""Airports cost a lot, so we do have to encourage a lot of tourists to come,"" she said, ""but we will be doing this in a balanced way, so as not to overrun local people.""
Por has just returned from a trip looking at travel opportunities in North Greenland, which will be accessible via direct international flights from 2026 when the new runway in Ilulissat opens.
""I went to a tiny town of 1,000 inhabitants, Qasigiannguit, and it was fantastic,"" she said. ""There are musk ox in the backcountry, historical reenactments at the local museum and so many whales! I heard them before I saw them from my bedroom, and they were everywhere we went.""
During the 2030 World Cup, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities, such as Rabat (Credit: Getty Images)
Morocco
Morocco is another nation keen to welcome more international visitors as it continues to develop its tourism infrastructure and build new hotels ahead of the 2030 World Cup, which it will co-host with Spain and Portugal. The North African country sees the tournament as a golden opportunity to boost tourism and is aiming to double tourist arrivals by 2030, to a whopping 26 million annual visitors.
Would you visit… Afghanistan?
Unlikely as it sounds, the Taliban has started running training sessions for hospitality and tourism professionals amid growing flight connections into the country. Tourism is being seen as a way to create jobs and boost the economy. However, just because a country wants to encourage visitors, it doesn't mean you should go. The UK Foreign Office and US State Department continue to advise against all travel to Afghanistan.
Barbara Podbial is a Morocco specialist adviser at travel agency Flee Winter and has been visiting the country for more than 20 years. She's seen the difference tourism has made to the country first hand.
""Tourism has had a positive impact in Marrakesh,"" she said. ""You can see it in the cleanliness of the streets, it's very safe, and people are not pushing you to buy things now the way they were before. But, with so many budget flights bringing in tourists, it can feel very busy.""
Increasing flights into Marrakesh is certainly part of the plan when it comes to developing Morocco's tourism industry, so it's unlikely that the city will be quieter any time soon. When it comes to the World Cup, however, the spotlight will fall on the country's lesser visited cities – Casablanca, Agadir, Fez, Rabat and Tangier – where stadiums are being renovated, tourism is being further developed and hotels are being built.

Of these locations, Barbara recommends Fez, Morocco's cultural capital, which has the largest medina in the world and is not over touristed. She also recommends day tripping from Agadir, a popular package holiday destination, to Taroudant, nicknamed ""little Marrakesh"". ""It's a short drive from Agadir and is an authentic, non-touristy city,"" she said. Also close to Agadir, the coast near the fishing village of Taghazout offers surf lessons on sandy beaches, while those planning a trip to Marrakesh can also include an excursion to the High Atlas mountains, a couple of hours drive away.
With the emphasis being thrown on further developing major cities in Morocco, the secret to an authentic holiday there may well be to use them as a base to discover lesser-visited spots nearby.
Serbia
Serbia doesn't have to look far to see a travel success story: in neighbouring Croatia, tourism has been a runaway hit. But while the city of Dubrovnik has had troubles with overtourism, Serbia is focusing firmly on sustainable development, working with the Global Sustainable Tourism Council to develop projects that don't encourage mass tourism, but look for a more sensitive, culture-oriented path forward.
This is partly because the country's tourism strategy has shifted. In the past, the focus was largely on city experiences, for example in Belgrade. However, with the realisation that tourism can help diversify rural livelihoods and improve local economies, mountain tourism, rural tourism and spa and wellness offerings have become an important part of the mix.
""In Serbia, people see the word 'tourist' as a positive thing,"" said George Colvin-Slee, a Serbia specialist adviser at Cox & Kings. ""It's an undiscovered place for a lot of people – we send more people to Albania and Bosnia – but it's got some really impressive spots.""

The country's mountains draw skiers in winter and hikers in summer; ecotourism is developing in the hills along with birdwatching; and natural springs in the foothills feed resorts and wellness hotels. And while tourists are enjoying these nature-packed experiences, local businesses are getting a boost and jobs are getting more secure. It seems to be working: international tourism grew by 20% in 2023.
Colvin-Slee recommends visiting Novi Sad, the country's second city. ""There's Hapsburg heritage in this region, so you'll find chocolate-box buildings like in Prague and Budapest but barely anyone there in terms of tourists. The food is also Austrian-influenced – strudel and goulash – and there are some great sights, including the Petrovaradin Fortress, nicknamed the 'Gibraltar of the Danube'.""
Georgia
Georgia, which borders Turkey, Russia and Azerbaijan by the Black Sea, has big plans to encourage everyone from disabled visitors and independent travellers to cruise tourists, with a vast port in Batumi, the country's second city. Its new 10-year development plan takes in everything from developing international signage so tourists can navigate the country solo, to improving accessibility, public transport and cruise ship ports as it opens up.
""Tourism is relatively new in Georgia,"" said Natalie Fordham, a Georgia specialist at Wild Frontiers, a tour operator specialising in offbeat and adventurous destinations. ""It offers a relatively new career path and we see really fantastic guides as a result. They're super excited to be part of it, they speak great English and learn how to adapt to different people, and many of our travellers make friends with them and want to go back.""

As a developing tourism nation, some of the things you might take for granted in Western Europe –such as an extensive paved road network – are not there yet. However, there's hope that revenue from tourism will help to drive these kinds of infrastructural initiatives.
""Tbilisi is my favourite capital city in the world,"" said Fordham, ""with charming cobbled streets, a real aesthetic, old fortress walls, museums and more. Then you've got cave towns, Soviet architecture and history – Stalin was born here – and the northern and southern mountains, Unesco churches and monasteries, and a thriving wine and food scene. There's so much to see, you need a week-long trip at least.""

The Ribeira Sacra is located in Galicia, Spain’s north-westernmost region (Credit: Getty Images)
In the Ribeira Sacra's dizzyingly high landscapes, near-vertical vineyards are perched above rivers. The stunning scenery – and the resulting wines – are an oenophile's dream.
A mosaic of stone and trees, the mountains stretched out toward the horizon while below me the river sliced through this unyielding mass of granite as if it were made of sponge. Peering down the pitched slopes of the Sil Canyon from the Cabezoás overlook – more than 700m high – I gained new respect for the incredible power of water (while thanking the sturdy beams that were holding me up).
Vertiginous views are a hallmark of the Ribeira Sacra, a collection of small towns that mostly hug the Sil and Miño rivers in Galicia, Spain's north-westernmost region. Galicia is often referred to as ""green Spain"" for its verdant landscapes, the product of frequent rainfall compared to elsewhere in Spain, but it's these two rivers that have shaped the Ribeira Sacra, the region’s most inland corner. The name means ""sacred riverbank"" in the Galician language, a nod to both the topography and the area's long monasterial history, dating to Roman times.
It's not the easiest terrain to cross, filled with narrow winding roads that wrap around hills and cut through stands of chestnuts and oaks. As I left Cabezoás, I headed west to the region's main monastery, Santo Estevo de Ribas de Sil, about 7km away as the crow flies, but nearly double the distance by car. Nested high above the Sil River, Santo Estevo has been beautifully restored and is now part of Spain's national network of paradores (state-run hotels often housed in historic structures). Although it is first mentioned in documents from the 10th Century, the monastery is believed to be several centuries older than that. It includes three cloisters, a church and the monks' quarters, and I couldn't help but wonder how they built such a massive compound back then on the rim of a mountain
Those monks definitely had an eye for prime real estate, but the miradoiros (scenic overlooks) I passed along the way provided a different kind of religious experience. Like Cabezoás, they jut out over the edges of cliffs, mocking gravity and offering vistas that will fill your heart or stop it cold, depending on how you feel about heights. Water has forged its own green cathedrals here, more monumental than even the most spectacular structures built by humans.
The vineyards are so steep that the grapes can only be harvested by hand (Credit: Getty Images)
In fact, the Ribeira Sacra was declared a biosphere reserve in 2022, and it is Spain's only nomination for Unesco World Heritage status in 2024. The application revolves around the central place of water in this landscape. Beyond the production of hydroelectric power, the rivers have propelled a long history of milling – corn and other grains – but it's the nearly vertical vineyards along their banks that play a starring role.
GREEN GETAWAYS
Green Getaways is a BBC Travel series that helps travellers experience a greener, cleaner approach to getting out and seeing the world.
Winemaking took off after the arrival of the Romans and the monastic orders that followed them. The region's predominant grape is Mencía, traditionally used to make fresh, young reds, though winemakers are increasingly adding a little Brancellao, Sousón, and Caíño, and even aging some of these earthy, aromatic blends, as well as producing beautifully floral whites starring the Godello grape. For a long time, wine quality suffered here, hindered by rural poverty and tangled land-inheritance laws, but the Ribeira Sacra's star has risen sharply over the past decade, with connoisseurs now seeking out its boutique bottlings.
It is also a naturally sustainable wine region, as no other approach would work over the long term. Because of the terrain, grape growers must harvest by hand, carrying heavy crates on their shoulders, as they advance carefully down row after acrophobia-inducing row of vines. To help with this gruelling work, a few vineyards use rails, along which grapes can be moved in small motorised containers – either up toward narrow clearings where they can be loaded onto a truck, or down to the river for boat transport – but this is not an option for most.
How to visit
The tourism board runs three free shuttle bus routes, with stops near several monasteries, wineries and piers where you can access city-run ferries. The ferries leave from Monforte de Lemos and Belesar, offering a loop of the Sil or Miño canyons. You can also sign up for private boat tours with Quinta Sacra or Turismo Pantón, which include visits to wineries and other attractions.
Established as an official wine region in 1996, the Ribeira Sacra holds ""heroic viticulture"" designation, awarded by an Italian nonprofit that promotes and protects mountainous wine regions around the world. To qualify for the title, your terraced vineyards must have a minimum altitude of 500m and a gradient above 30%. When I met winemaker Puri Díaz Ferreiro, she casually referred to local vineyards as paredes (walls), which makes sense when you consider that a 70% slope is not unusual. She rightly marvelled at what must have gone into creating these terraces. ""It was an immense job to build these walls and ensure they don't collapse. They've lasted for centuries.""
The Adegas de Vilachá wine cellars were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption (Credit: Puri Díaz Ferreiro)
Most wineries here are small operations, like Díaz Ferreiro’s Val do Frade, based in the town of A Pobra do Brollón. Working alone, she grows grapes on two half-hectare plots, one of them perched on a luxuriantly green ridge high above the Sil River. During harvest, she hires extra hands to move her grapes to the Adegas de Vilachá complex 2km away, where she produces just 3,000 bottles per year of a young red made with Mencía. Now an ethnographic centre, these rustic cellars date to medieval times and were traditionally used by families to make and store wine for their own consumption. Every midday, folks would head there on foot, via a narrow path, and bring home enough wine for the day's meals. While the complex has 42 separate cellars, just 12 are currently in use, and Díaz Ferreiro's is the sole commercial operation.
Her vineyards can only be accessed on foot, from above. While I found the lush highland scenery to be breathtaking, I wanted to get closer to the water, so I headed west to the village of Belesar to meet Martín Martínez. Established in 2020, his Ecosacra winery is what's known locally as an adega de garda (storage winery), where wine that's been made elsewhere is kept in cool, north-facing cellars. More than three centuries old, his adega had been abandoned for 14 years when he bought and restored it, even reusing old wine barrels to make shelving and tables. It's a beautifully rustic space overlooking the Miño River, with an outdoor patio where you can try his wines – a white made with the Godello grape and a red Mencía-dominated blend – while dining on local cheese, charcuterie and empanadas (Galician large-format baked meat or fish pies), accompanied by tomatoes, figs and cherries from his own garden.
TIP:
Where to stay: Spend the night in monasterial surroundings at Santo Estevo, or stay at As Torres da Ermida, a boutique hotel in Monterroso in the former home of an aristocrat.
Where to eat and drink: A wine tasting is included with your tour (in Spanish only) of Val do Frade. Ecosacra's VIP experience includes a boat ride, wine tasting and meal. For a sit-down dinner, visit A Faragulla in Chantada, or nosh at Monforte de Lemos' tapas bars, clustered around Rúa Cardenal Rodrigo de Castro.
To reach Ecosacra, I booked a tour that included a magical journey on Martínez's small boat. As we glided past forested riverbanks so densely green they could pass for Tolkien's Shire, I was humbled by the view of those mindboggling vineyards; it was beyond me how those first grape-growers ever conceived of farming this terrain. But even more remarkable was the canyon itself, a testament to the sheer force of water across geological time.
Ecosacra's name reflects Martínez's commitment to protecting his natural resources. Like Díaz Ferreiro, he takes a low-intervention approach in his vineyards, conserving the soil's health and using no herbicides or insecticides, and his small catamaran is the first hybrid passenger boat in the area. As we chatted, he proudly told me about the otters that were spotted near his private pier. ""I spend most days on the river, but I never get bored of this place. It’s paradise to me.""
In summer, the 17 Grados festival celebrates the magnificent landscape alongside the music (Credit: Mattias Monsterkid)
The team behind local event company I-Radia Crea felt the same way when they created 17 Grados, a music festival that highlights the landscape. Named for the vineyards' minimum slope in degrees, the lineup features concerts at a hilltop winery, but the most coveted events take place on a catamaran with a maximum capacity of 100. Listening to music while cruising between the steep walls of the Sil Canyon is a transcendent experience, transporting you physically and metaphorically.
To protect the very qualities that make the area so unique, government officials are beginning to take a more mindful approach, learning hard lessons from other parts of Spain where overtourism has sparked the rage of local residents. In its promotional materials, the tourism board encourages visitors to arrive by RENFE, the national train system, which stops in the region’s largest municipality, Monforte de Lemos (population: 18,000). There are also free hop-on hop-off minibus shuttles to reduce car traffic during the summer and Holy Week peak seasons; and the most popular attractions – such as the ancient Santa Cristina de Ribas de Sil monastery and the wineries themselves – require advance reservations to manage visitor volume.
It's not easy to balance environmental protection with the real economic needs of the Ribeira Sacra's small towns, which might otherwise be abandoned, like so many in rural Spain. But in a region where survival has long depended on nature, there is still a deep connection to the environment, and many locals are focused on conserving what they've inherited. When Díaz Ferreiro first started growing grapes, some of her neighbours would describe the ways they pruned each plant in their vineyards.
At the time, she couldn't imagine anyone having such an intimate understanding of individual vines, but now she has become one of those people. ""I don’t know how to explain it, but it is something that you just have to feel,"" she said. ""We are in contact with the earth, the plants and everything else around us. I’m part of this landscape.""

(Credit: Alamy)
Steeped in history, it played a central role in Roger Deakin's groundbreaking book Waterlog that kick-started Britain's wild swimming movement.
""The Waveney for me, as my local river, has always been a kind of escape route,"" the late naturalist and wild swimming enthusiast Roger Deakin once said in a BBC radio piece. ""It's a way into another world.""
The Waveney is my local river, too. And as this year marks 25 years since Deakin's ground-breaking book Waterlog: A Swimmer's Journey Through Britain, which arguably launched Britain's wild swimming movement by embracing the outdoors, encouraging the ""right to swim"" and arguing that ""natural water has always held the magical power to cure"", I wanted to journey the length of this waterway most Brits haven’t heard of with a dip, kayak and pedal about to unearth its allure.
Deakin lived for 26 years in a 16th-Century farmhouse in the village of Mellis, four miles south of the Waveney, where he would swim in its moat. His regular wild dip sparked the idea of 36 swim adventures in places across Britain. Breaststroke inspired pen stroke and his cult classic emerged. In his three dozen plunges for Waterlog, he took in the Isles of Scilly with a snorkel and submersions in ice-cold tarns in Wales. But the Waveney was his favourite river and he would return to it time and again, devoting much of the chapter Extinctions to the waterway.
The Waveney was Deakin's favourite river, but few Brits have heard of it (Credit: Claire Boobbyer)
The Waveney was a ""secret river"" he wrote, ""by turns lazy and agile, dashing over shallow beds of golden gravel, then suddenly quiet, dignified and deep… With its secret pools and occasional sandy beaches, the Waveney is full of swimming holes, diving stages improvised from wooden pallets, dangling ropes and upturned canoes pulled up on the bank.""
Slowcomotion is a BBC Travel series that celebrates slow, self-propelled travel and invites readers to get outside and reconnect with the world in a safe and sustainable way.
Deakin often biked to many of his wild swimming destinations. ""The quality of cycling is akin to swimming,"" he described in Waterlog. ""I enjoy the gliding, swooping motion of the bike as I enjoy the grace of swimming.""
Deakin canoed the Waveney, too. He produced a radio documentary for the BBC on paddling the river from its source at Redgrave and Lopham Fen via Hoxne to the Geldeston Locks in a vessel named Cigarette.
The Waveney meanders along 59 miles of the Norfolk-Suffolk border in East Anglia before slipping into the River Yare and nosediving to the sea at Great Yarmouth. Along its willow tree-shaded watery kinks are an award-winning vineyard, an award-winning cheese dairy, craft breweries and indie cafes. Otters, kingfishers, endangered lapwings and water voles call the river home.
The Waveney remains underdeveloped and under-the-radar (Credit: Claire Boobbyer)
Drainage mills, which once emptied the marshes of water for crops and cattle, remain upright, like sentinels. In winter, an elusive mantle hovers over the gloam with ghost-white mills looming large; reeds stiffen with frost. In spring, pussy willow seed fluff settles on the river like the softest of snow. And in summer, birds chatter and hedges swell with wild blooms.
The Waveney marks the southern extent of the Broads National Park, but it's all quite under-the-radar and deliciously underdeveloped, with barely a road alongside. My partner and I cycled as close to the river as possible to trace its route and uncover its secrets. From Diss, a Norfolk market town (handy with its railway station), we cycled 104 miles across four days over gently undulating river valley to the sea, staying at B&Bs along the way.
Five miles west of Diss, Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories. Edmund the Martyr, the 9th-Century king of East Anglia, and England's original patron saint, hid from enemy soldiers under Goldbrook Bridge. His golden spurs, reflected in the water, betrayed his position and he was given up by a passing wedding party. At the St Edmund's Cross memorial nearby, which commemorates the site of his capture and beheading at an oak tree, a gardener told us: ""Wedding folk don't use that bridge even now. They go around.""
Hoxne is a quaint village home to extraordinary stories (Credit: Claire Boobbyer)
Edmund's story is somewhat eclipsed by that of the Hoxne discovery of 15,000 coins, the largest hoard of Roman gold and silver ever found in the UK.
After a swift pint mulling treasure at the timbered Swan Inn, we pedalled down a lane fragrant with wild garlic to what is arguably the most beautiful mill house on the Waveney. Deakin thought so, too, as he mentions it as a highlight in his radio piece.
Slow travel along the Waveney
Suffolk Bike Hire offers one-way rentals for cyclists. Ramblers can walk the Angles Way (which is sometimes aligned to the river and sometimes gives it a wide berth) from Knettishall Heath to Great Yarmouth. Walkers and bikers may also want to use Hike Help, which transports luggage between B&Bs.
Just south of the town of Harleston sits Shotford Bridge. Beneath, there's a popular swimming spot that's looked after by The River Waveney Trust. ""The [wild swimming] movement highlights that people do want to swim in rivers and the water quality should be good enough for everybody to swim,"" said trust director Martha Meek.
After a swim in the cool river shaded by willow branches drooping into the water and glancing red dragonflies and damselflies in sapphire blue darting about, we refreshed at The Cap, a craft brew pub in Harleston, for a pint of Ampersand's Bidon pale ale and a summery Basil Blush with raspberry.
We then cycled to the village of Mendham, crossing the bridge spanning the river and water meadows in the early evening sun as cows munched the grass. We stayed at the pocket-friendly Sir Alfred Munnings Hotel. The pretty mill at Mendham (now a holiday let) straddling the river is the birthplace of Sir Alfred Munnings (1878-1959), known as England's finest painter of horses – some of whose early scenes depict life in the Waveney Valley.
Many animals call the river's willow tree-shaded waters home (Credit: Claire Boobbyer)
We glimpsed more valley life the following morning: Wortwell village's large striking-white weatherboard watermill is first mentioned in the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror's land survey of England. And at Homersfield village, we soaked up the sun-dappled river scene from a small bridge. Built in 1869, it's the oldest concrete bridge in Britain and arcs a sluggish spot in the river. We swam here, too, in the water, drinking in the wildness and romance. Water voles plopped into the river, their loud splashes breaking the peace. Deakin himself had spotted water vole holes ""the size of tennis balls in the banks"" as he paddled in Cigarette.
The Waveney at Bungay balloons in an oxbow curl. (Hire a canoe at Outney Meadow Caravan Park to paddle the waters here, and perhaps see an otter.) In Waterlog, Deakin swims around a bend in the Waveney and encounters an otter ""sunning itself on a floating log near the reed-bed"". Bungay is an enigmatic place with indie shops and cafes (great lunches at Earsham Street) and a 12th-Century castle. Known for its association with a demonic Black Shuck hound (honoured with an annual festival), lace curtains twitched in 2023 when it was called the Satanist capital of Britain.
Escaping any potential clutches of the legendary dog, we cycled north to Flint Vineyard. A glass of mineral-y, elderflower-y Bacchus Fumé primed us before we climbed Annis Hill for a glimpse of private Mettingham Castle. We revived on the smell and taste of Ethiopian coffee at Silo Café where beans roast in a soaring 1950s grain silo on the river at Wainford.
The caffeine powered us on to one of the Waveney's most enchanting scenes: the white weather-boarded Ellingham Mill that overlooks a river pool with drifting swans. From here, the rural Geldeston Road lured us east to another of the river's highlights – the Locks Inn – right on the water and known for its live music. Deakin ordered a pint here as he docked Cigarette at the locks.
The Locks Inn was one of Deakin's beloved watering holes (Credit: Claire Boobbyer)
Geldeston's bigger neighbour, Beccles, sits high on a cliff above the Waveney, with its huge church commanding the town. At Northgate street, the curved lane is riven with alleys that slope down to the river. In bygone centuries, wherries (sail boats designed to navigate shallow water) plied up and down the river's navigable arm to Beccles transporting goods such as malt, corn and coal.
After a night in the beamed 16th-Century Swan House, we organised a guided kayak tour to see more of the river via Hippersons Boat Yard. As our paddles chopped the silky water, our guide recounted stories of reed cutting; herring history; Norfolk and Suffolk rivalry; and the eel, carp and perch swimming beneath us.
The Waveney disappears into the marshes after Beccles. We didn't glimpse it again until beautiful Carlton Marshes Nature Reserve, 7.5 miles away. We explored the bird hides huddled in the reeds and looked out for booming bitterns, Chinese water deer and rare hovering marsh harriers.
The marshlands snuggle up to Oulton Broad, a spur of the Waveney via Oulton Dyke. We biked north to picturesque Somerleyton Hall & Gardens. Beyond, in Somerleyton village, a cylindrical monument honours the Hovercraft (invented in 1955) and its creator, Sir Christopher Cockerell. We parked our bikes at Somerleyton Cycles (which stores panniers) while we walked the dreamy, sun-drenched route by the water to the timber-framed, octagonal Herringfleet smock drainage mill, the last of its kind on the Broads.

It wasn't until we reached the Fisherman's Inn that we appreciated the past toil of the region's mills. From the pub garden, endless marsh and distant mills steamed in the glare of the sun. The river coiled about the flatlands shimmering like quicksilver.
Close to the inn are the thick, gnarly stone walls of vast Burgh Castle raised on a cliff at the confluence of the Waveney and the Yare. It's one of the best-preserved Roman monuments in Britain and while the west wall has collapsed into the marshes giving the high-perched ruins a million-dollar view, what's so sobering is that although mud, tides and time have shaped this shifting coastal area, the area is little developed since 3rd-Century Roman soldiers defended the estuary.
Our journey had indeed offered us an escape into an unhurried, wild and different world.

Louisiana streets flooded as Hurricane Francine hits Gulf Coast
Francine has left hundreds of thousands without power and caused widespread flooding after slamming the coast of Louisiana before driving inland.
It made landfall in Morgan City as a Category 2 hurricane at 17:00 local time (23:00GMT) on Wednesday, carrying winds of 100 mph (155 km/h), the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Francine rapidly weakened into a tropical storm before diminishing further into a depression on Thursday morning.
It was moving over central Mississippi on Thursday morning with 35 mph winds and is forecasted to head north toward Tennessee and the eastern edge of Arkansas, the NHC said.
A sign in Morgan City, where Hurricane Francine made landfall in Louisiana
Both Louisiana and Mississippi declared states of emergency and told residents to take shelter and brace for the major storm.
Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said at a press briefing on Wednesday that residents should ""stay off the roads, stay home and stay put"".
By Wednesday evening, the National Weather Service issued a flash-flood emergency warning, the most severe flood alert.
Heavy rain blanketed roadways and poured into houses.
Emergency crews in Lafourche Parish rescued 26 residents trapped in flooded homes, according to the sheriff's office, after inches of rain soaked the area.
Winds ranging from 60-80mph (96-128km/h) downed trees in Baton Rouge. A Louisiana State Police officer helping clean debris there was hit by a tree and transported to a local hospital, local news reported.
Francine is expected to continue to ""rapidly"" lose strength as it travels across Mississippi, forecasters say. It is forecast to weaken to a post-tropical cyclone by the evening.
The storm is still dropping heavy rain across Mississippi and its neighbours in Alabama, Arkansas and Florida, where 3in (7.6cm) to 6in is expected. Some areas in Alabama and the Florida Panhandle could see up to 10in of rainfall, leading to flash floods.
About 350,000 homes and businesses in Louisiana had lost power as of Thursday morning, according to Poweroutages.us. A combined 72,000 are seeing outages in Mississippi and Alabama.
BBC Weather Presenter Ben Rich with the latest on the track of Hurricane Francine
Officials in Jefferson Parish, part of Greater New Orleans, urged residents to stay home due to ""severe street flooding"" late on Wednesday.
Meanwhile the Morgan City Police Department said the city was experiencing ""unusual amounts of flooding"" and asked people not to drive on flooded streets.
Residents in eastern Louisiana, Mississippi, southern Alabama and western Florida had been warned of a life-threatening storm surge.
A storm surge means there is a danger of water rising from the coastline and moving inland. In some places, water may rise up to 10ft (3m).
Several of the state's coastal parishes are under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. Some schools and colleges have closed.
US oil and gas companies on the Gulf of Mexico, including Exxon Mobil and Shell, evacuated staff and paused some operations.
Francine brought heavy rains to New Orleans' famed Bourbon Street on Wednesday
Jefferson Parish, which neighbours New Orleans, asked residents to conserve water to prevent the sewer system backing up into homes.
Louisiana recently marked the 19th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which killed more than 1,800 people and caused widespread devastation.
The state mobilised resources and deployed water rescue teams before Francine arrived, the governor said, and was prepared to call on the National Guard for support if needed.
Francine’s development follows a quiet August and early September during the Atlantic hurricane season, which typically lasts until November. Experts earlier this summer had predicted a busier season.
Sarah Keith-Lucas, a weather presenter with the BBC, said the previous named storm in the region was Ernesto, back on 12 August.
""The last time we had no named storms during this same period was back in 1968.  Usually, this time of the year is peak hurricane season. Last year nine named storms formed between 13 August and 8 September.""
Francine is the sixth named storm of 2024.
Hurricanes are categorised on a scale of one to five. Category five storms are the most destructive, with winds in excess of 157mph (250km/h).

The destruction a fire brings can be crucial for certain species to thrive. Meet the conservationists reviving the ancient art of ""good fire"".
Every spring, more than 600,000 sandhill cranes migrate through Nebraska following the Platte River. Having arrived from as far as the southern US and Mexico, the birds linger in a location for weeks, fattening themselves during the day in the fields to prepare for their journey as far north as Siberia. They rise with the sun, pull their red-capped heads out from under their gray wings, and start their unmistakable vocalisations — a deafeningly loud bugling sound that churns repeatedly in their throats.
Then something amazing happens: they take flight in waves of the tens of thousands, leaving to feed in nearby fields before returning to the river at night.
To preserve it, conservationists are reviving an ancient but long-suppressed land management method: controlled burns.
Also known as ""prescribed burns"" or ""cultural fires"", these intentionally started, controlled fires have received growing attention in recent years, as a way to clear dry undergrowth that can build up and fuel huge wildfires. One 2024 review suggests that prescribed burning can reduce the severity of wildfires between 62% and 72% relative to untreated areas. However, the idea of prescribed burns is not new. Indigenous communities long used ""cultural fires"" to remove old grass and support new growth. In addition, controlled fires may also help create a healthy ecosystem for cranes and other species by creating open habitats.

""Grasslands are one of the most endangered ecosystems globally, with research showing a 60% decrease in grassland biodiversity since the 1970s,"" says Amanda Hefner, education manager at Audubon's Rowe Sanctuary. ""So the best way we can make sure that the grasslands stay grasslands, is by making sure that we're using tools to keep it in that habitat — tools like prescribed fires.""
Prescribed burns involve planning specific patches to set on fire. Those patches might be near firebreaks, like a road, or burn specialists might mow breaks around the burn area, which removes litter and dry grasses that could help a fire spread. They will also spray it with water to keep the fire from spreading to the break. They must take into consideration things like humidity, wind direction and where they want the fire to be pushed by that wind. If they've cut out a U-shape, for example, they move the fire forward until the section is completely burned. The team works together to keep it under control. Patches are usually relatively small, and timing depends on the last time they were burned, whether grazing animals are willing to eat there, which invasive species are taking over and how the area is being used by wildlife.
The fires are part of an effort to restore the cranes' natural habitat, which conservationists say used to be shaped through an intricate interplay of natural cycles and indigenous communities' intervention. Human impact has entirely transformed that original habitat, meaning that a full return to the original conditions is impossible, and making this form of partial restoration crucial.

A crane paradise lost
In its original shape, the once wide, but relatively shallow Platte River provided an open space for the cranes to roost, while also keeping an eye on predators. These four-to-five-foot tall birds with wingspans of six-to-seven feet found abundant plants and insects to eat on the Nebraskan prairies. Lightning strikes brought occasional wildfires, which cleared out dead material and refreshed native plant life.
""It's estimated that, especially in the central Great Plains where Nebraska is, there was somewhere between a five and seven year fire return interval,"" says Josh Wiese, range manager for the Crane Trust. ""An acre would have burned every five to seven years."" These could have been wildfires caused by lightning strikes or even indigenous cultural fires, he noted.
""Indigenous people were on the land and would have seen those lightning fires,"" and replicated them with controlled burns, says Christensen. Depending on the nation, she says, there were specific experts – fire chiefs, grandmothers, or families – with the knowledge and the responsibility for cultural fires. These cultural fires prevented the meadows from becoming forest again, and cleared land in a way that would make it easier to hunt rabbits, weasels and even bison, she says.

A shrunken river
The River Platte also changed. As European settlers moved West, cities dammed up the Platte and shrank its flow and size, allowing for encroaching woody, plant-life to spread inward at the river. According to the Audubon center, human activity reduced channel widths in the Platte River by 80-90%. Nebraska's wetlands and prairies became farmland, leading to roughly 75% of those wild spaces disappearing. Without their original sources of a rounded diet, birds were left eating a dominant meal of waste grain, which is primarily corn, that is leftover in the fields from the harvest.
Even with these changes, cranes have proven to be highly resilient birds, with more than half a million arriving annually from February to early April, putting on a massive display. While the River Platte is the biggest sandhill crane migration corridor, smaller populations can be found migrating through other parts of the US, like Lodi, California, where there's even an annual festival. Thirty minutes away from Rowe at the Crane Trust, approximately 10,000 acres are protected as critical habitat for endangered whooping cranes and sandhill cranes.
Both Rowe and the Crane Trust use grazing bison or cattle along with controlled burns to maintain the open grassland and prevent shrubs from encroaching. The Crane Trust even has its own bison herd for that purpose.
""We use [burns] to control invasive species, like eastern red cedar, for example,"" says Tim Smith, director of land management for the Crane Trust. ""If you let it go, and it becomes cedar dominated, that is an unusable habitat for sandhill cranes.""

Dancing prairie chickens
Prescribed burns are done in patches, meaning that not all is burned at once. Some areas are chosen based on where bison or cattle aren't grazing or where there is fuel, like litter. Burning in patches also creates greater diversity through micro-habitats for different species that prefer tall or short grasses, says Wiese.
""Patches of habitat increase biodiversity and [support] important keystone species like prairie chickens,"" adds Hefner. ""Short vegetation allows them to dance and mate [in areas known as ""leks""], but they also use taller vegetation to hide their nests from predators.""
Experts say that, elsewhere, other prairie-based wildlife, plant life and insects also benefit significantly from the power of fire, including huckleberries, grizzly bears and bees.
""My father is a grizzly bear biologist,"" says Charlie McLellan, a fire and vegetation specialist for Parks Canada. His father, researcher Bruce McLellan, ""worked his whole career over 45 years on grizzly bears in southeastern British Columbia"". Charlie and his sister, Michelle — who are both now bear specialists — have been around grizzlies their whole lives. He says he's seen the influence of fire on bears' habitat and activity, which is also documented by research on grizzlies and other bears.
During the fall and approaching hibernation, bears rely on food that fattens quickly, both as preparation for the winter months and for giving birth. For some bears along the Pacific Coast, salmon plays a big role in fattening up; for others in the Rocky Mountains, it's berries, like huckleberries. These calories are crucial for a successful pregnancy. If there aren't enough calories, would-be mother bears will even delay implantation of the egg.
According to Charlie McLellan, his father's research showed the importance of burns for creating huckleberry fields. Female bears, he said, were having fewer ""cubs, and having them later in their life, [with] a longer period between litters when those huckleberry fields weren't as productive.""
Once, while tracking some collared bears, he could see that the bears were favouring a specific, very remote location in Yoho National Park of Canada. He investigated old fire maps to find out if there had been a fire in this area and discovered it had burned in 1973. It's a testament to the importance of these burns, he says.
""I really do think of huckleberries as a keystone species,"" said Tabitha Graves, a research ecologist with the United States Geological Survey at the Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center. Huckleberries, she says, are supporting bees during the flowering stage, and supporting migrating birds and small mammals when they're ripe. ""So it's really not just bears.""
According to her research, bees are the primary pollinators of huckleberries — 85.6% of which are bumble bees. Periodic fires promote huckleberry growth and help push out competition.
Pointing to Bruce McLellan's research, Graves says that huckleberries have been tied to the bears' habitat selection, abundance, survival chances, and reproductive success and dispersal — ""so basically, all of the life processes.""
She notes that indigenous people have pointed to cultural burns as being used to improve berry production. The Yakama Tribe uses fire to promote huckleberry growth, and recently, the Karuk and Yurok tribes in California have been reviving their fire traditions to promote the growth of berries' as well.
Back at Rowe Sanctuary, the last of the sandhill cranes lift off to continue their journey north. Dedicated birders can return home and thaw out their fingers from that biting Nebraska wind. Tourism may slow down, and the cranes might be gone, but the land managers at Rowe and Crane Trust have their work cut out for them, making sure that there is a welcoming habitat for the next migration – using good fire to bring the spectacle back and to ensure the birds have a future.

The 31-year-old looked a shadow of the striker who is Englandâs all-time record goalscorer with a series of laboured and lacklustre displays at Euro 2024 in which he looked short of fitness and way off the pace.
Here at Wembley, against moderate but well-organised opposition, the Bayern Munich forward was a threat throughout with only Hradecky standing between Englandâs leader and the goal he so desperately wanted.
In the end, Kane was the winner of what was becoming a personal battle, triumphing in emphatic fashion with two comprehensive goals.
It was a poignant night as well as one of celebration at Wembley, with tributes paid to former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson, who died recently, before Kane received his golden cap from Frank Lampard as well as a bouquet of flowers from Finlandâs captain Hradecky.
Kane has been well aware of the justified scrutiny he came under after such a poor Euros but the two goals here took him to an outstanding tally of 68 goals in his 100 England appearances as he demonstrated he can still be a formidable player in the post-Gareth Southgate era.",100.0,16.666666666666668,0.07500000000000001,0.5953125,18.25,24.0,4.0,44.21,15.8,15.0,10.92,19.1,10.32,15.0,63.64,11.0,15.13,1.95,6.46,0.85

""It will be a case of getting myself up to speed as quickly as possible, and just as importantly getting to know everyone here as quickly as possible, and how we get the best out of each other,"" he said.
""They [the new rules] are an opportunity. Whether we will be able to capitalise on that, we just donât know. I donât spend too long fretting on these things. Just get on and do the best we can.""
How will he perform his role as managing technical partner? He joins forces again with technical director Dan Fallows, who was head of aerodynamics at Red Bull under Newey before joining Aston Martin in early 2022.
Newey, Fallows said on Tuesday, ""goes where he thinks he can add value"". He draws the fundamentals of the car layout on his fabled drawing board, analyses reports, sits in some meetings, and contributes and asks questions and guides where he feels it is needed.

The thrilling penalty-shootout win over France gave La Albiceleste their first World Cup since national hero Diego Maradona guided them to the 1986 title.
And it sparked an explosion of joy in Argentina, where the media saluted the nation's latest generation of World Cup heroes, and their talisman Messi.
Images of him holding the trophy aloft and the team's celebrations adorned news websites and social media feeds in Argentina.
Messi's Argentina had won ""the greatest final in history,"" said the daily La Nación, while Clarín described it as an ""unforgettable"" match.
The sports daily Olé's homepage was splashed with ""We are world champions!""
The final was billed as a titanic showdown between Messi and French superstar Kylian Mbappé, and it did not disappoint the neutrals.
While Messi scored from the spot twice to put Argentina in the lead, Mbappé inspired the French fightback with a hat-trick to take the final to penalties.
""Head held high,"" read the headline on the front page of French sports daily L'Équipe, the text imposed on an image of Mbappé holding his Golden Boot prize as he walked past the World Cup trophy.
""Legendary,"" said the front page of the daily Libération, with photos of both Messi and Mbappé, while Le Figaro described the French star's efforts as ""heroic.""
'In the Hand of God'
Messi had cemented his place long ago among the greatest of all time, but the football world was abuzz ahead of the final with the prospect of the fleet-footed magician crowning his glittering career with the World Cup – the one major trophy he had never won.
And with Argentina's win on Sunday, the debate about his stature in the history of the sport was settled for most.
In Britain, The Times said on its front page that Messi had won the ""battle of modern maestros in greatest final."" On the front page of its sports section, it described him as, simply, ""The Greatest.""
The Mirror called him the GOAT – ""greatest of all time"" – while The Sun said the World Cup was ""In the Hand of God"" – a cheeky reference to Maradona's infamous goal against England in the 1986 tournament.
In Germany, Süddeutsche Zeitung also played on that reference with the headline ""The foot of God"" for Messi.
It called the Argentina-France showdown ""the most exciting final"" in World Cup history, while the daily Tagesspiegel said it showcased ""two exceptional talents.""
Even in Brazil – an intense rival – the O Globo newspaper paid tribute to Messi, saying football had ""paid its debt"" to its biggest star.
In the United States, which will host the next World Cup with Canada and Mexico, a report in The Washington Post said Messi was finally rewarded in an ""immortal"" final.
Spain's El País newspaper said Messi had been ""crowned in the final of finals.""
And in Asia, where Messi has legions of fans, Indian newspaper The Hindu said his Argentina team had kept their ""date with destiny,"" while South Korean daily Hankook Ilbo called him a ""god of football.""",303.0,14.428571428571429,0.29017628205128204,0.5951373626373626,13.28,63.0,3.0,54.26,12.0,13.1,10.22,14.2,8.97,18.25,47.83,14.0,38.16,1.8613861386138615,5.897689768976898,0.6633663366336634

Laureus World Sports Award 2024 Nominees
USA – 2024 Laureus World Sports Awards Nominees
London, Feb.  26, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Laureus, the global organization that uses the power of sport to change the world, today announced nominations for the prestigious Laureus World Sports Awards. Since their inauguration in 2000, these Awards have brought together the biggest names in sports and entertainment to celebrate the greatest athletes on the planet – and this year the list of Nominees includes U.S athletes from the NBA, tennis, track and field, gymnastics, surfing and skiing.
The Laureus statuette has become one of sport’s most wanted prizes among elite sportsmen and women, and these are the athletes’ awards – voted for by the 69 members of the Laureus World Sports Academy: Olympic champions, world-record breakers, athletes who redefined their sports and who now make up the ultimate jury on sporting greatness.
This year, the U.S is represented by Sha’Carri Richardson, who won 100 metres gold at the World Athletic Championships in Hungary. In her first global final, she recorded a time of 10.65 seconds, the fifth-fastest in history, and she is nominated for the Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year Award. Joining Richardson on that shortlist – alongside athletes including world tennis No.1 Iga Świątek and soccer’s World Cup-winning star Aitana Bonmatí – is Mikaela Shiffrin, who in 2023 became the most successful alpine skier of the World Cup era with a record 87th win (she finished the year on 88). At the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships, Shiffrin won a seventh career gold, in giant slalom.
Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year Nominee Mikaela Shiffrin, said: “There is nothing like the Laureus Awards when it comes to bringing athletes together to celebrate not just what we’ve all achieved, but the impact sport has globally. Laureus gives us a unique platform to interact with each other and make a difference. 2023 was an absolutely incredible year for me—and was even more special after what I’ve experienced in the last few years. Since I reset the record last season, I’ve thought a lot about why a record is actually important to an athlete…and I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s not important to merely break records or reset records. It’s important to set the tone for the next generation and inspire them. That’s why I’m honoured to be nominated for the Sportswoman Award once more alongside such an inspirational group of fellow athletes.”
No sprinter since Usain Bolt had swept the sprints at the World Athletic Championships until Noah Lyles won gold in the 100 and 200 metres, plus the 4 x 100 metre relay in Budapest. That earns him a spot on the shortlist for the Laureus World Sportsman of the Year Award, where he is joined by sporting greats including Lionel Messi, who led Inter Miami to victory in the Leagues Cup, and Novak Djokovic, winner of three Grand Slam tennis titles in 2023.
Simone Biles is nominated in the category of Comeback of the Year after she returned to gymnastics after a near two-year absence that began in the aftermath of the Tokyo Olympics, where she withdrew from four of five individual finals after experiencing what gymnasts call ‘the twisties’ – when mind and body become detached during routines. She returned to competition in 2023 and won four gold medals at the World Championships. In the same category, Jamal Murray of the Denver Nuggets is nominated after he returned to the court after an 18-month rehabilitation of a torn ACL sustained in April 2021. As Denver won its first championship, Murray was a giant in the NBA Finals, becoming the fourth player in history to average over 20 points and 10 rebounds.
The Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year Award goes to an athlete who joined the elite in 2023 – and the Nominees in this category include Coco Gauff, who won her first Grand Slam title at the age of 19. And her breakthrough came on home soil – Gauff defeated Aryna Sabalenka in the final of the US Open. Gauff is joined by athletes including Qin Haiyang, the Chinese swimmer who was the breakout success of swimming’s world championships, and Jude Bellingham, who scored 10 goals in his first 10 games for Real Madrid after joining the world’s biggest soccer team before his 20th birthday.
Florida surfer Caroline Marks is nominated for the Laureus World Action Sportsperson Award after winning her first world title. At the age of 22 she defeated five-time champion Carissa Moore at San Clemente, California. The winner of the men’s event there, Brazil’s Filipe Toledo, is also among the Nominees, as are two teenage skateboarders, Australian Arisa Trew and Rayssa Leal of Brazil.
In the Team of the Year category, Nominees include Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula One Team, who put together a near perfect season, the Springboks who won back-to-back Rugby World Cup titles, plus the Germany team who were surprise winners of the FIBA Men’s Basketball World Cup.
On the shortlist for the Laureus World Sportsperson with a Disability Award are athletes including Diede de Groot, who is unbeaten in wheelchair tennis over an incredible 127 matches, and Markus Rehm, who is just as dominant in long jump – he won a sixth Para Athletics World Championships title, to go with four Paralympic golds, and he secured a 14th world record.
The Laureus World Sports Awards also honour the work of over 300 programmes supported globally by Laureus Sport for Good, using the power of sport to change the world. Shortlisted programmes for the Laureus Sport for Good Award this year include Dancing Grounds, a New Orleans-based project that connects dance and creativity with social justice issues and fosters leadership and citizenship skills in the young people who attend.

33,https://scroll.in/field/867489/under-19-over-the-moon-how-the-indian-press-reacted-to-fourth-junior-world-cup-win,"India won their fourth Under-19 World Cup title on Saturday after beating Australia by eight wickets in the final at Mount Maunganui in New Zealand.
Opener Manjot Kalra smacked an unbeaten 101 in even time as India easily disposed of Australia’s total of 216 with more than 11 overs to spare.
The opener’s century included eight fours and three sixes, and he was well supported by wicketkeeper Harvik Desai, who was 47 not out when he finished the match with a boundary.
The pair put on 89 for the third wicket, while Prithvi Shaw scored 29 at the top of the innings and Shubman Gill added 31.
The Sunday editions of Indian newspapers were magnanimous in their praise of the Rahul Dravid-coached side, with most newspapers splashing images of the win on their front pages. Here is how the Indian press reacted.
The Times of India published a box on the title win as one of its front-page leads, titled, “When the world became their cup”.
“On Cloud 19!” exclaimed the Times of India on its first sports page. “India’s Under-19 cricketers on Saturday lifted a record fourth U-19 World Cup trophy after an eight-wicket rout of Australia in the final, bringing to a dream end a perfect campaign in which they thoroughly dominated every other team in the tournament,” the report said. “The win also gave former India captain Rahul Dravid the biggest success of his coaching career.”
The Sunday Express had a front-page report – with a rather straight headline – from Mount Maunganui about how the team celebrated the victory and how coach Rahul Dravid, typically, asked them to not dirty the dressing room and move the party outside.
The Sunday Express’s sports section had a more colourful headline: “Under-19, over the moon”.
The Hindustan Times front page ran a similar headline to the Indian Express:
In its sports section, HT listed out 19 reasons why India conquered the world, including the “legend of Rahul Dravid”.
“Hitting a 4: Boys to men”, said DNA’s headline in the middle of its front page.
“As has been the case throughout the 2018 ICC U-19 World Cup, India’s dominance put even the law of averages to shame, with the team thrashing Australia in the final in Tauranga on Saturday to clinch the title and script a perfect climax to their unbeaten run in the tournament,” wrote Chander Shekhar Luthra.
The English daily even ran a staff report in the sports section, with the headline “Boys conquer world, again”. The report said that “Prithvi Shaw and his young troops showed maturity beyond their ages, thrashing Australia by eight wickets to gift India a record fourth ICC U19 World Cup title and underline the fact that India has the best junior cricketing setup in the world”.
The Mumbai Mirror went with a rather expected “Students of the year”.
The New Sunday Express had a photo of Shaw lifting the trophy right next to its masthead. Below that was a report with the headline, “Shaw & Co paint fresh graffiti on the Wall”. Note the capital W in Wall.
The report noted how the U19 players were referring to coach Dravid by his first name. “Kids don’t call their coach by his name. But then, these boys are different, like the coach,” the report said.
The lead sports page at the back of the newspaper had another report, headlined, “Understudies in Wall of Fame”, again a reference to Dravid. The report noted Dravid’s message to the boys after winning the World Cup.
“Fourth title – conquered the world,” said the Sunday Navbharat Times’s front-page headline.
NBT’s headline on its sports page was a lot more clever, with a pun on Manjot Kalra’s first name.
“The stage was set and everyone’s attention was on Prithvi Shaw and Shubman Gill,” the report said. “But the showstopper was Delhi’s Manjot Kalra.”
“Young India’s royalty,” was Amar Ujala’s front-page headline.
“Dravid’s brave-hearts are the champions,” was the headline of its report on the sports page.
The Telegraph carried a tiny staff report at the bottom left of its front page, headlined, “Dravid’s dynamos deliver”.
It’s main sports page at the back was dedicated to the win.",390.0,12.1875,0.24025361431021808,0.40414726782651306,10.49,75.0,2.34375,59.74,9.9,11.4,9.52,11.2,8.33,16.25,42.79,10.0,49.34,1.7615384615384615,5.843589743589743,0.6076923076923076
34,https://as.com/us/futbol/estados-unidos-y-el-mundo-con-los-ojos-en-lamine-yamal-n/,"Después del apasionante partido de ida que se vivió en el Estadio Olímpico de Montjuïc, donde FC Barcelona e Inter de Milán regalaron un marcador de 3-3 para arrancar con su eliminatoria de semifinales dentro de la UEFA Champions League 2024-25, este martes todo se definirá desde el Giuseppe Meazza. Los reflectores, como se viene haciendo costumbre, están sobre Lamine Yamal.
En un aspecto que llama poderosamente la atención al tratarse de la fase de los cuatro mejores equipos en la Copa de Europa, el joven de 17 años genera mucha expectación y se espera que para este juego de vuelta contra el conjunto Nerazzurri vuelva a tirar del carro blaugrana. Al terminar el primer capítulo, el extremo derecho se marchó del césped con un semblante serio y recibió algunas palabras de Flick.
Cabe destacar que en la ida marcó un golazo para revivir al Barça y después fue el hombre que brindó la claridad en el ataque, por lo que recibió elogios de diferentes personalidades en el mundo del fútbol. Jamie Carragher, leyenda del Liverpool, comentó: “Fue como ver a Messi en su mejor momento”. En el mismo programa de CBS Sports para Estados Unidos, Thierry Henry destacó: “Es simplemente una locura lo que está haciendo. Es anormal”.
Otro de los hombres que colaboró con su reflexión sobre el dorsal ’19’ del FC Barcelona fue Rio Ferdinand, quien se refirió a él en su podcast: “Creo que, Lamine Yamal, en este momento, no sé si hay alguien más emocionante a quien ir a ver a un estadio en este momento”. Enseguida de esto se recordó su importancia en la Eurocopa de España y el hecho de que ha marcado en octavos, cuartos y semis, por lo que el mítico zaguero del Manchester United simplemente agregó: “Balón de Oro”.
El presentador de televisión Nico Cantor, en su programa para CBS Sports en territorio estadounidense, comentó: “Cuando Lamine Yamal tiene el balón, para mí el mundo se detiene. Cuando Lamine tiene el balón, va, da una pausa, se hace el silencio y lo dejas hacer su magia. ¿Cuál es la reacción cada vez? ¡Oh, wow! ¿Eso es lo que haces ahora? ¡Es un jugador de clase mundial!”.
Finalmente, otra de las voces que compartió su sentir por la presentación de Yamal en la ida fue Hérculez Gómez, quien a través del programa ‘Ahora o Nunca’ de ESPN Deportes, destacó: “Es un jugador de otro nivel, es un jugador de otro planeta […] ¿Qué está pasando? Yo a los 17 años estaba jugando en la preparatoria. Lo hizo en un juego de Champions League, fue claramente el mejor de la cancha”.

35,https://talksport.com/sport/3179136/zhao-xintong-world-snooker-championship-luke-littler-mark-williams/,"Beaten finalist Mark Williams believes newly-crowned world champion Zhao Xintong could be snooker's answer to the Luke Littler phenomenon.
Zhao took out the 2025 World Snooker Championship with an 18-12 victory over Williams on Monday to become the first Asian winner of the sport's marquee tournament.

It was far from a straightforward victory for Zhao as Williams came back from 17-8 down to rattle off four consecutive frames.
However, Zhao showed plenty of composure as he stopped his rival's momentum in the 30th frame to claim victory.
Although he was understandably frustrated not to have won, a gracious Williams believed the Chinese star's triumph at the Crucible may be the necessary springboard to launch his career and give some of snooker's heavyweights a serious challenge.
""Nothing but admiration for him (Zhao),"" Williams told talkSPORT after the final.
""To do what he's done, he's been out for two years, come back, pretty much won every game from the qualifying past everyone in the main tournament, is just an incredible achievement.
""I haven't got enough nice words to say about him. He's just brilliant to watch, pots for fun, makes breaks and good luck to him.
""I think he can earn a few quid out of this. I think everyone's just got to get behind him and just watch him because he could dominate or at least give [Judd] Trump or Kyren [Wilson] a run for his money.
""I think it's needed as well with the Luke Littler thing in darts.
""I think this is what snooker needed, someone like him to come through. The way he plays is just effortless.""
Littler took darts by storm when he burst onto the scene by reaching the final of the 2024 World Championship aged just 16.

Now 18, Littler is the biggest attraction in the sport and went one better at the Alexandra Palace in January as he beat Michael van Gerwen in the final.
Littler's success on the oche has seen him take home in excess of £1million, although that figure does not include his many endorsements and exhibition fees.
As for Zhao, his triumph at the Crucible has already seen him, as Williams said, 'earn a few quid' given the tournament winner would take home a cool £500,000.
Zhao's victory completed a remarkable career turnaround given he was suspended for 20 months over his involvement in a match-fixing scandal.
Although Zhao never directly threw a match, he was charged with being a party to another player who fixed two matches while he also bet on matches himself.
As part of the suspension, the 28-year-old was booted off the professional circuit and subsequently relegated to amateur status but regained his spot via the Q Tour.
3
Thanks to his win at the Crucible, Zhao will surge up the world rankings all the way to 11th when he returns to the professional tour.
Zhao's triumph marked an historic occasion as he became the first amateur to win the World Championships since the tournament moved to the Crucible in 1977.
He also became just the third world champion to hail from outside the United Kingdom since 1997.",276.0,11.5,0.12005555555555553,0.4136111111111111,11.77,66.0,2.75,57.81,10.6,12.7,9.46,11.9,8.76,13.4,45.27,12.0,36.65,1.8478260869565217,6.130434782608695,0.7391304347826086

But Williams was in a somewhat jovial mood after missing out on the trophy, posing for a snap with his conqueror after the match.
And he jokingly pretended to punch the Chinese 'Cyclone', raising his fist to his face as they posed for a snap.
Snooker fans loved the sportsmanship from Williams, with one saying: ""Mark taking it well. Love this.""
Another said: ""Mark Williams is a class act. And Zhao, what a champion.""
And another said: ""Great character, always liked Willo.""
One remarked: ""You just can't not love Mark. What a fella.""
Another chimed in: ""With a laughing emoji: Never change, Willo!!""

Laura married fellow cycling icon Jason Kenny before they welcomed their first baby, Albie, in 2017.
After securing another gold medal in 2021, she then miscarried that November.
And just five months later she had an ectopic pregnancy.
Pregnancy Myths explained
There are a lot of strange myths around pregnancy - and some of them may surprise you...
In 2023, she then welcomed another son, Monty.
Speaking on Radio 4 about her fertility struggles previously, she said: ""Everything was a shock - I went from being so in control of my body to being so out of control.""
She also said: ""Was my body just running on empty, and then it said, 'Well, hang on, there's no way we can do this?'.""
She spoke about how elite sport might have a damaging impact on the fertility of female athletes.
In 2024, Laura retired from cycling as a sports person.
She told BBC Breakfast last summer: ""I always knew deep down I would know when was the right time.
""I have had an absolute blast but now is the time to hang up the bike.
""It’s been in my head for a little while, the sacrifices of leaving the children and your family at home is really quite big and it is a really big decision to make.""
She went on: ""More and more, I was struggling to do that.
""More people asked me what races I was doing, what training camps I was going on.
""I didn’t want to go ultimately and that’s what it came down to.""
During her career, Laura won five Olympic golds, seven world golds, 14 European golds, two Commonwealth titles, and six golds at the European Under 23 Championships.

The Dutchman faced Mensur Suljovic in the third round at Alexandra Palace.

Van Gerwen produced a blistering display to lead a high-quality affair after four sets.
Leading 3-1, the three-time world champion set himself up for a match dart with the fifth set level at 2-2.
However, despite Suljovic having a finish on 161, Van Gerwen snubbed the chance to take out 121.
Instead, Mighty Mike opted against going for the bullseye and pinned single 18 to leave himself 32.
Sky Sports commentator Wayne Mardle was stunned, exclaiming: ""He’s not gone for it. He thinks someone averaging 101 over nigh on five sets is not going to take out 161.""
Van Gerwen's decision immediately backfired as his opponent stepped up to the oche.
Suljovic expertly responded with triple 20, triple 17 and the bullseye for a 161 checkout.
His heroics clinched the set to reduce Van Gerwen's lead to 3-2 as the Ally Pally crowd erupted.
Meanwhile, the Austrian celebrated passionately before smiling and shaking his head at the third seed's expense.
Mardle was almost speechless as he reacted, commenting: ""That is insane. That is insane.""

The four-time World Championship semi-finalist could then be heard in hysterics as replays of Van Gerwen's reaction were shown.
He stood stony-faced as Suljovic completed his checkout to punish the Dutch darts ace.
Mardle continued: ""Look at his face. Look at his face. That is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever seen. Look at Mensur.""
After composing himself, the pundit added: ""Look at Michael’s face. Yes, Michael, it happened.""
Fortunately for Van Gerwen, he was able to spare his own blushes in the following set.
By taking the sixth set 3-1, he clinched victory in the match 4-2 to move through to the last 16.
Van Gerwen would go on to make it all the way to what was his sixth final in London.
Michael Smith would claim a 7-4 victory, though, to deny MVG a fourth world title.",189.0,7.269230769230769,-0.07023809523809524,0.600297619047619,8.59,32.0,1.2307692307692308,66.23,7.4,9.7,8.52,7.7,8.98,8.333333333333334,37.72,9.0,24.53,1.7301587301587302,5.915343915343915,0.746031746031746

The 17-year-old made his first appearance in a live TV studio environment on Tuesday night on Foxtel’s The Back Page.

Donning Real Madrid’s bright orange away kit, along with tracksuit pants and sneakers, the Queenslander comfortably handled the spotlight on a panel that included NRL great Greg Alexander and Bulldogs champion Brad Johnson.
He showed his youthful exuberance when he busted out a “griddy” dance move on the set (which you can see below), making a far better fist of it than budding F1 star Oscar Piastri after his victory in Monday’s Miami Grand Prix.
In an entertaining chat, he also made a little backhanded swipe at the Collingwood footy club.
Gout has taken Australian sprinting by storm over the past 18 months, dropping some ridiculous times on the track and drawing regular comparisons to Jamaican legend Usain Bolt.

He has broken a string of junior marks and dropped a stunning 20.04 seconds at December’s Australian All Schools Championship, breaking the national 200m record held by Peter Norman since 1968.
Among a host of questions that were fired his way, Gout was asked the main goals for his career.
While he conceded the Bolt comparison “gets tiring”, he immediately invoked the name of the eight-time Olympic gold medallist who holds both the 100m (9.58s) and 200m (19.19s) world records.
“I think the limit is just obviously winning Olympics and winning world championships and honestly dominating like Bolt did,” he declared.
“I think that limit is reachable for me.”
With sprinters typically reaching their peak in their late 20s, many have tipped Gout to star in his home Olympic Games in Brisbane in 2032.
But the confident youngster is already eyeing off the Los Angeles Games in just three years’ time.
“The times I’ve run so far could potentially make it into finals, make the top four, top five, top six,” he said.
“Just getting better and aiming for LA obviously would be a great achievement and trying to be on that podium running against (Olympic 200m gold medallist Letsile) Tebogo, Noah (Lyles), (Lachlan) Kennedy, all them athletes.
“That’s definitely a goal in mind and keep aiming for the top.”
Alongside fellow sprinter Lachie Kennedy, Gout was the star attraction for the annual Stawell Gift on April 21.
Yet organisers were left to lick their wounds after both fan favourites were bundled out in the semi-finals.
The dynamic duo both finished second in their respective races as they were unable to overcome their harsh handicaps.
Gout had a better outcome at the Australian Athletics Championships in Perth that same month, breaking the magical 10-second barrier twice en route to the under-20 100m crown.
In a wind-assisted effort, meaning it didn’t go into the official record books, the Queenslander ran identical times of 9.99 seconds in his heat and the final.
Gout was asked about those issues with the wind in his chat.
“Every race when I try to run fast the wind either hits me with a head wind or hits me with a crazy tailwind,” he said with a smile.
“So I just hope sometime in the future, sometime this year, I get a nice little tailwind and I’m able to run really fast.”
Studying his HSC at Ipswich Grammar School this year, Gout also trains six times a week, along with two gym sessions.
He’s become friendly with American champion Lyles, who won the 100m gold at the Paris Olympics, with the pair training together earlier this year.
Asked the areas where he can find improvement in his young career, Gout said “Some of it is definitely physical. I’m still a teenager and haven’t grown into my body yet.
“Still getting my grown man’s strength, as Noah would say, and just working on those little aspects, a couple of things at the start, gaining power and strength.
“Those little things really take you to the next level.”
Gout said his running style, where he appears to bounce off the track with his huge strides, is partly “god-given talent” and partly the work of intense training.
He is trying to adjust to his new found fame, including bumping into members of the Collingwood footy club on a recent flight.
“I was star gazing myself and they came up to me asking for a photo, so I was like that’s pretty crazy,” he said before throwing in a little joke.
“These athletes are obviously amazing, Collingwood is cool, Brisbane Lions are better, but people asking me for photos is great.”
While the 100m is the blue ribbon event on the sprinting schedule, he said the half-lap race is actually his favourite to contest.
“Definitely have a favourite in the 200, (it’s) by far my favourite because I’m not the greatest starter, but when I get onto top speed I run people down,” he said.
“So 200 is my favourite.”
Gout will be heading to Europe in June and July and with some favourable head winds, will start to show the rest of the world his talent and improvement.
Patrick Johnson remains the only Australian to record an official time under 10 seconds for the 100m, with his 9.93 seconds in Japan back in 2003 still the standard bearer for the country’s male sprinters.
But it seems it’s well within Gout’s reach as the budding superstar progresses in his young career.

40,https://apnews.com/article/f7c50fbfdb48e6ba9cbdceb4201e4d3c,"TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — Once considered a saloon or rec-room past-time by many, snooker has long been serious business in the U.K. and much of the rest of the world. Now, it seems, it’s China’s turn in the spotlight.
Zhao Xintong’s crowning as Asia’s first world snooker champion has put the focus on the growth of the sport in China in a relatively short time.
“There’s a new superstar of the game,” said Mark Williams, 50, the three-time World Champion from Wales who lost to Zhao in the final of the World Snooker Championship, held in Sheffield, north England, on Sunday. “It could be huge for the sport.”
Brought to China by foreign traders in the 19th century, snooker suffered during the early Communist period, when all pastimes seen as individualistic, bourgeois and foreign were frowned upon. The first ranking event to be held in Asia was the Hong Kong Open in 1989. The following year China hosted the Asian Open.
The death in 1976 of Mao Zedong, opened the doors for the sport and snooker has now moved from smoky backstreet parlors and outdoor shopfront street-side tables — amazingly kept level by the bricks they sat on — to swanky halls and practice venues.
Former world No. 1 Ding Junhui blazed the trail for Zhao and others like him, even as enthusiasm for the sport may be waning somewhat among a younger generation infatuated with e-sports and smartphone games.
Zhao himself may be the best thing to happen to China-British relations in recent years, with ties under pressure over trade and China’s curtailment of democracy in the former British colony of Hong Kong. The 28-year-old now lives and trains in Sheffield, and enjoyed strong support from the British fans at Sunday’s final.
Raised in the bustling industrial center of Shenzhen, Zhao picked up a cue at age eight and, somewhat surprisingly for education-obsessed Chinese parents, received strong support from his parents, who built him a practice room at home.
That didn’t fully shield him from the shadier side of the sport, however. He was banned for 20 months as one of 10 Chinese players implicated in a match-fixing scandal. Zhao owned up to knowledge of the what was happening, although he said he wasn’t directly involved. He returned to the sport in September 2024 as an amateur. requiring him to battle his way back up the ranks.
Dubbed “The Cyclone,” Zhao now stands at 11th in the world rankings and his combination of youth and talent is being celebrated across the country.
His expressions of disbelief at his world title was witnessed by millions of television viewers in China, with many praising him in online posts as the “pride of China” who “brought tears to one’s eyes.”
“It’s worth celebrating in China,” said Tong Jianfeng, 29 and long-time fan of the game. “Through the whole process, Zhao Xintong played smoothly. His precision is impressive.”
Huang Siyuan, also 29, agreed, “It didn’t come easy. I feel proud for Chinese billiards.”
Wang Heng, the manager and founder of Beijing Xinrui Billiard Academy, located in Tongzhou, just outside the capital, said Zhao’s success will be positive for the domestic game.
“I believe this will make Chinese players very confident because they would realize the world championship is no longer something difficult to break,” he said. “They will be more and more sure of themselves.”
There may already be more Zhao’s in the works. At this year’s world championships, 10 Chinese players qualified for the main draw and six made it into the final 16 — the highest ever.
“Now this will give them (children in China) power and in the future many Chinese players can do this,” said Zhao covered in confetti and a Chinese flag after taking the title.
International recognition will be crucial to the sport’s continued growth, according to Jason Ferguson, chairman of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.
“The one thing we do know about China is that snooker is treated like any other major Olympic sport, it is on a pedestal, it does get major broadcast hours and it really is supported by government and education systems,” Ferguson told The Associated Press.
“The sport is extremely well-respected. To have a world champion is really just incredible.”

Despite Stawell Gift organisers left to rue harsh handicaps given to headline talent Gout and Kennedy at this year’s Stawell Gift, the event was an overwhelming success.

Bumper crowds made their way to Central Park for all three days and it has led the Victorian Athletic League (VAL) - which organises Australia’s oldest footrace - to consider tabling a bumper offer to the reigning 100m Olympic gold medallist in an attempt to get him to race Gout on Australian soil in what would certainly attract record crowds.
“There are a couple of people angling in that space … There are a few influential people that have some backing that suggested they’re going to try to see what they can do. There’s plenty of people around with money to support that,” VAL president McDonough told Wide World of Sports.
“Someone might say, ‘Look, we can spend half a million to get Noah Lyles’, and he might not come for that.
“Who knows? By the time we get to next year, Gout could be just as big as Noah Lyles.
“ … (But) we’d be interested (in bringing Noah Lyles to Australia), the VAL, and I’m sure Stawell would. We would be super excited to have any of the international superstars come along, like one of those big-name Americans, to take on Gout.”
This year, local businessman Sandy McGregor – the majority owner of Prince of Penzance, the horse who won the hearts of Australia when it took out the 2015 Melbourne Cup with Michelle Payne aboard – paid $50,000 for Gout to tear down the 110m grass straight.
But his generosity hasn’t stopped there as he will also continue to support Gout as he heads overseas with to race in Europe and Asia this year.
McGregor has reportedly committed $150,000 to the Aussie phenom so he can contest several races abroad.
Gout will next compete in the 200 metres at the Ostrava Golden Spike meet in the Czech Republic on June 25 (AEST).
He will then set his sights on gold at the world championships in Tokyo in September.",229.0,13.470588235294118,0.13338471293016746,0.3488871397962307,12.97,43.0,2.5294117647058822,63.53,10.5,12.2,9.06,12.8,9.02,14.75,45.63,13.0,28.57,1.755458515283843,5.781659388646288,0.7554585152838428

The 54-year-old was found guilty by a Darts Regulation Authority (DRA) of fixing 12 Modus Super Series matches between February 2022 and July 2023, as well as passing information on to bettors.

Jenkins denied match-fixing but admitted to placing 88 bets on matches between March 2022 and May 2023.
This admission saw him receive an additional 12-month suspension, which will run concurrently with his other sanctions.
The lengthy ban has been backdated to November 2023, when he was one of three darts players to be suspended over suspicious betting patterns, alongside Prakash Jiwa and Jack Main.
It will prevent the Englishman from being involved in any DRA event until November 2034.
Jenkins has also been ordered to pay costs of £17,580, and has until May 6 2025 to appeal the decision.
John Pierce, director of enforcement at the Gambling Commission, which worked with the DRA on the case, said: ""This case sends a strong and unequivocal message to all sportspeople - if you fix matches, you are likely to be caught and face serious consequences.
""Betting customers in Britain deserve confidence that the markets they engage with are fair and free from corruption.
""Our sports betting intelligence unit will continue to work closely with partners such as the Darts Regulation Authority to identify and prevent match-fixing.""
Jenkins' ban comes after Jiwa was hit with an eight-year ban in March for fixing four games and betting on the outcomes of others.
Meanwhile, Main received a two-year ban from the DRA for match-fixing in February.

Jenkins is best known for his run to the semi-finals of the PDC World Darts Championship in 2007.
Ranked number 12 heading into the prestigious event, 'Rocky' knocked out household name Adrian Lewis in the last 16, before  losing to ultimate champion Raymond van Barneveld in the final four.
Since then, he has struggled to replicate this form, failing to progress beyond the second round of the World Championship in four further attempts, the last of which came in 2013.
Prior to his impressive 2007 exploits, Jenkins reached the semi-finals of both the 2002 World Grand Prix and the 2004 UK Open.
After losing his PDC Tour Card at the end of 2014, the Hampshire native was forced to enter Qualifying School in 2015, where he won his card back for two more years, before losing it again in 2017.

ITV has done an excellent job covering the two sports over the past decade and more, showcasing the best of Luke Littler and Ronnie O’Sullivan.

Their coverage has been fronted by respected presenters Jill Douglas and Jacqui Oatley and expert analysis has been provided by former world champions Stephen Hendry and Ken Doherty.
But from 2026, it is believed multi-sport promoter Matchroom Media will produce the two sports themselves – except for top Sky Sports and BBC events.
Production staff involved behind-the-scenes at the World Snooker Championship were given the bombshell news this week that the ITV package would be changing by the end of the year.
And many individuals, including pundits, commentators, floor managers and make-up assistants, are likely to miss out and see their freelance work dry up.
More information will be revealed this month and Channel 5 are also rumoured to be involved in some capacity and potentially showcase live snooker on their terrestrial TV platform.
A one-year extension for snooker on ITV was announced in September 2024 and covered this season’s British Open, Champion of Champions, Players Championship and Tour Championship.
On the darts side of that deal, PDC events in 2025 included The Masters, UK Open, European Championship and the Players Championship finals, as well as a minimum of seven global events from the World Series of Darts.
One source told SunSport: “Gutted as the guys who work on it are brilliant and we’ve all had the best fun working hard to try to produce quality TV. But money talks and that’s life.

“So, no more ITV presenters and pundits, just whoever Matchroom ‘host’ broadcaster uses.
“A big kick in the guts. ITV people are brilliant. Everyone’s very upset. Poor freelance floor managers, makeup artists, losing a lot of work.”
Asked about the collection of ITV snooker events finding a new home, Matchroom Sport founder and president Barry Hearn said: “It’s nearly done.
“There’s going to be a mixture of broadcasters because quite honestly, broadcasters like snooker. You know, it’s delivering ratings.
“We live in a numbers game. ITV4 has been fantastically successful for us in the numbers it’s got.
“So, obviously some of the other stations want snooker. And I think in the next couple of weeks we will lay out the deals that we’ve done.
“It’s going to involve a multiple number of broadcasters. Some free-to-air, some behind the pay-model.
“But it’s a compliment to where snooker is that it’s in demand.
“We need to be more encouraging to the younger market, which involves talking to them in the language that they understand and the medium that they understand.
“And that’s why the world is becoming more digital. The future is more Netflix than free-to-air.
“People will be able to watch what they want to watch, the sports they want to watch, when they want to watch it and for a price they can afford. I find that really exciting.”
ITV, Channel 5, the PDC and WST all declined to comment when approached by SunSport.

Nearly everything in sports in 2023 felt like it was about to end. It isn’t, of course: The Super Bowl is still happening next year, even if having it in Las Vegas does seem a little on the nose, end-of-days-wise. But an industry whose foundations are consistency and tradition — the idea that no matter what’s going on with the rest of the world, sports will always still happen — has been acting as if the future is highly precarious.
Baseball players are signing contracts that will pay them $68 million in the year 2043. College football is hoovering up every dollar it can with the understanding that the golden goose could croak at any second. The sports-media business has devolved into its crawling–across–the–parking–lot–at–the–end–of–The Wolf of Wall Street phase. There’s a nonzero chance the Saudis will own half our sports teams in a decade (if we even make it that long as a country). Right now, the whole sports business is looking over the horizon and seeing nothing but uncertainty. The motto seems to be “Grab what you can while you can.”
Here, a look at the ten biggest sports stories of 2023.
For the third consecutive year, athletes, coaches, and, especially, leagues stayed as far away from politics as they possibly could. LeBron James disbanded his More Than a Vote organization. Major League Baseball gave the All-Star Game back to Georgia. The NFL’s strongest statement on social justice was painting “End Racism” in end zones. (This does not seem to have ended racism yet.) I haven’t read the word “Trump” in a sports-related story in months. The unprecedented political activism of 2020, a year in which players actually refused to play postseason games because of racial injustice, has almost completely evaporated, allowing leagues and players to stay out of the political discourse. They should enjoy it while they can — as should the rest of us — because this is going to be impossible in 2024. But they’ll still give it a try. I wouldn’t expect LeBron to be hosting any Biden rallies this time around, that’s for sure.
It has been a long time since Major League Baseball made any sort of decision that didn’t end with everybody screaming at it. So it must have been disorienting for the league when its much-ballyhooed rules changes, from banning the shift to making the bases bigger to — most dramatically — adding a pitch clock — weren’t just accepted by the public but in fact celebrated. The average length of game was down more than 25 minutes from last year, and it felt that way, too, with more stolen bases, more balls in play, and a crisper pace of play that reminded many of why they fell in love with the game in the first place. Now that this sweeping set of changes has been embraced, prepare thyself: More reforms are on the horizon, and they may be even more dramatic. Robot umps: They are coming.
As someone who has surfed the highs and lows of the sports-media racket for 20 years, I’ve learned that nothing is stable, that you can never get too comfortable, that in a year nothing will look the way it does right now. But even in that context, this business is completely upside down right now. ESPN is shedding jobs and appears to be at the weakest position in its history. Sports Illustrated is publishing AI writers. The only thriving media personalities are essentially doing a series of extended wrestling promotions. My God, they’re making up sideline reports now: Is nothing sacred? I used to mock parents, including my own, who told their children not to go into sports media. Now if either of mine even think about it, I’m kicking them out of the house. Save yourselves, kids.
Travis Kelce was already one of the most famous players in the NFL. But neither he —  nor, really, the NFL — knew what  fame was until the Chiefs tight end started dating the planet’s biggest pop star. Suddenly, Swifties were diagramming plays, Aaron Rodgers was trying (and failing) to pick a vaccine fight with Kelce in order to restore his fading clout, and networks were broadcasting more cutaway shots of Swift celebrating in the skybox than they were instant replays. Be as cynical about this relationship as you want, but all told, they both seem like pretty nice people who enjoy each other’s company. That the NFL and Swift both got bigger from this surprising, and surprisingly still ongoing, union — well, that’s a happy coincidence, I am sure.
To be fair: The NFL didn’t really need Swift’s help. It continues to set every TV ratings record imaginable — the top-three-rated shows of the year were all NFL programming — and that’s not even accounting for all the streaming platforms, most notably Prime, that have paid the league billions to air its games. The league skated past every potential controversy with no problem at all, even turning the tragic Damar Hamlin story into something you could feel good about. It has separated itself from the rest of the sports world so dramatically that every other sport is starting to feel like something people only kind of pay attention to just because there isn’t any football on. The NFL may expand and expand until it is the only thing left.
The sports world resisted for a while, but eventually you can only pass up that much money for so long. This was the year the Saudi Arabian government’s long-standing efforts to break into sports finally worked. The best soccer stars, save for Messi, were happy to play in front of nearly empty stands in the Saudi league if it meant they’d make nine figures. More and more teams fell under Saudi ownership. The NBA refused to rule out potential Saudi investment. And, in the biggest coup, LIV Golf, the direct competitor to the PGA that vivisected the sport in 2022, shocked the world by announcing plans to merge with the PGA, making everyone who stood against it (including Tiger Woods) look foolish for thinking anything else would happen. You think Steve Cohen is a controversial owner? Wait until a Saudi fund buys a baseball team or an NFL team. It’s coming and soon.
Ohtani began the year by striking out teammate Mike Trout to win the World Baseball Classic. He ended it by signing the biggest contract in sports history. In between, he won his second MVP, dominated baseball the way no one ever has (including Ruth) and … once again failed to make the playoffs. That’s why he’s a Los Angeles Dodger now. There are serious downside risks to Ohtani’s new contract, but he’s the most famous baseball player on the planet and one of the most recognizable athletes. He’s doing something no one has ever done. Who cares how much longer he’ll be able to do it? Just soak it all in: We’re so lucky we get to witness his greatness.
For years, fans of women’s sports have been arguing that if executives and television networks would just give their leagues exposure, audiences would follow. That sure seemed to be the case this year. The Women’s World Cup was a massive success, even if it didn’t go well for the United States. The University of Nebraska hosted a volleyball game that featured the biggest crowd to ever see a women’s sports event (92,003 people!). Stars like Coco Gauff, Simone Biles, and A’ja Wilson gained stature and championship trophies. The most fun women’s sports moment might have been the women’s basketball Final Four, when Iowa’s Caitlin Clark and LSU’s Angel Reese, the sport’s transcendent talents, squared off in a battle that got millions of people who had never watched a women’s basketball game before to tune in. (It was much more interesting than the men’s Final Four.) People will watch. They always would have.
UCLA and Oregon are in the Big Ten. Texas and Oklahoma are in the SEC. Colorado and Utah are in the Big 12. There are 12 playoff teams now. Players are getting paid millions and transferring wherever they want to go. The NCAA is being sued by everyone. Coaches are telling the NCAA to buzz off and no one cares. College football has learned that there’s gobs of money to be made by becoming NFL-Lite, a revelation that has led the sport to dissolve itself in front of our eyes. No sport is taking more end-of-days attitude right now than college football. Who knows what it will look like in a decade, if it even exists? For now, it’s riding a bomb, Slim Pickens style, waving its cowboy hat and whooping until everything goes black.
FanDuel. MGM. Caesars. Barstool. ESPN Bet. The experience of watching a sporting event is not dissimilar now to watching one of those old house channels in a Vegas hotel: Just a bunch of creepy scam artists flashing numbers at you and screaming. The Supreme Court’s decision to make gambling legal (in states that wanted to legalize it anyway) opened the door to the betting industry spackling itself over every inch of every sport, everywhere. Now it’s not just networks that are governed by gambling but the leagues themselves. This is going to end disastrously. It’s possible it already has.

Talk about surprising, how about 700 million reasons for your jaw to drop? After months of speculation, and plenty of tracked flights on FlightAware, Shohei Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. The deal obliterated the previous highest overall deal (Mike Trout's $425.6 million) and highest annual deal (Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer's $43.3 million) in history. Admittedly, it's kind of like you're signing two players at once, so maybe $350 million per player isn't so bad?
Of course, adding to the shock was the news that Ohtani will actually be deferring $68 million per year! The vast majority of the contract ($680 million) will actually be paid out from 2034 to 2043, according to ESPN. So, the good news is I still have 10 years to become best friends with Ohtani.
OK, so admittedly this is a bit of a pre-surprising moment, but sometimes a sports moment is so shocking you have to prepare yourself mentally. Maybe the most famous marker in sports history was the 4-minute mile. It's so famous that many people know the name Roger Bannister even if they couldn't tell you anything about him other than he was the first to run a mile under 4 minutes. No other race distance and time has rivaled that fame, but that may be ending soon.
In October's Chicago Marathon, Kenyan Kelvin Kiptum (say that five times fast) lowered the world marathon record to 2 hours and 35 seconds, tantalizingly close to breaking the two-hour mark. It's likely, especially in an Olympic year, that the barrier could be broken in 2024.
College volleyball team musters record-setting crowdThe University of Nebraska’s Memorial Stadium was the site of a new record-setting event, as over 92,000 people gathered to watch its women's volleyball team.
ABCNews.com
In a banner year for women's college sports, we couldn't help but take note of two insane attendance records set this year. In August, the Nebraska women's volleyball team played in front of a crowd of just over 92,000 fans. No, that is not a misprint. It wasn't just the largest crowd for a college women's sporting event, or largest for a women's sporting event in the U.S. It's actually the largest crowd ever for a women's sporting event in the entire world.
The match was played at Memorial Stadium, home to the Cornhuskers' football team. (Not like Nebraska football was worth watching.) Before you ask, yes, it was paid attendance.
Sticking to the Midwest, the Iowa women's basketball team set a record of its own with an outdoor game in October at Kinnick Stadium, their football field, where 55,646 fans showed up. For an exhibition! Of course, Ms. Hawkeye Caitlin Clark was there, so we're a little surprised the entire state of Iowa didn't show up. She posted a triple-double in the win over DePaul, which set a record for the largest attendance ever for a women's basketball game.

When is an undefeated record in a Power 5 conference not as good as a one-loss record in a Power 5 conference? When you're Florida State and you've lost your star quarterback. The final year of the four-team College Football Playoff snuck in one final controversy before expanding to 12 teams in 2024-25 when the Seminoles were left holding the bag despite winning every game they played. Two one-loss teams (Alabama and Texas) snuck in ahead of Florida State in what was a no-win situation for the selection committee.
On one hand, the controversy filled talk shows for a week. On the other, Jordan Travis was out for the year and Alabama and Texas are likely the better teams on the field at this point.
By the end of December, Florida State had sued the Atlantic Coast Conference, saying the Seminoles' snub ""crystalized the years of failures by the ACC to fulfill its most fundamental commitments to FLORIDA STATE and its members."" This came one day after the ACC had filed a preemptive lawsuit against the FSU Board of Trustees, saying the school has ""obligations to the Conference to which it has belonged and from which it has profited from for more than 30 years."" As if the state of conferences in college sports weren't a big enough mess, we're now hurtling toward a complete collapse of the system.
United States' Simone Biles competes in the uneven bars during the women's all-round final at the Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Antwerp, Belgium, Friday, Oct. 6, 2023.
Virginia Mayo/AP, FILE
Simone Biles, with nothing left to prove on her all-time great resume, surprised everyone with her announcement in June that she wasn't quite done owning the rest of the world in gymnastics. Biles missed most of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 due to mental health issues. She cited a case of the ""twisties"" -- a mental block that causes you to lose your bearing in the air -- as a reason for pulling out of most events.
But at 26, she said she wasn't quite ready to let that be the final memory she left on the international stage. Biles returned to competition and looked exactly like she did in the lead-up to Tokyo, winning everything in sight, including the U.S. championship (for the eighth time) and world championship (for the sixth time). She'll be the favorite in Paris to take home several more golds, including her second all-around title.
Oh, she also got married in April to Green Bay Packers safety Jonathan Owens and started a little Biles vs. Swift controversy, but that was just for funsies.
There is no name more polarizing in the world of pro wrestling* than CM Punk and, if you reside on a certain portion of the internet, no name more heavily discussed. Punk spent the better part of the last 10 years ranting about how terrible it was working for the WWE and how glad he was to be rid of the company when he walked out in early 2014. He promised to never wrestle for WWE again and even dueled in court with the company's head doctor.
But after a truly bonkers first half of 2023 working for WWE's main rival, All Elite Wrestling, in which he got into multiple fights backstage, including allegedly lunging at company owner Tony Khan, guess who was back in WWE in November? Punk showed up at Survivor Series in his native Chicago to a massive pop. It's not exactly the Monday Night Wars yet, but the drama behind the scenes is often more exciting than on screen.
(*Save your philosophical discussions for another time, because we're considering pro wrestling a sport for the purposes of this list.)

The jury is still out -- as it has been for decades -- about whether the U.S. will ever truly love soccer, but there's no question the best player in the world kicked up a new level of interest in the sport in the States this year. Lionel Messi, coming off Argentina's win in the 2022 World Cup last December, decided to join MLS side Inter Miami in June. Maybe most impressively, he spurned a massive contract offer from a team in the Saudi soccer league, where clubs have been snatching up A-list players for hundreds of millions of dollars in a ""sportswashing"" campaign.
Messi debuted in July with Inter Miami winning the Leagues Cup in August and then debuting in MLS competition in August and scoring 11 goals in 14 matches. He also generated increased ticket sales everywhere he went. His team didn't make the playoffs, but Messi did win the Ballon d'Or in October as the world's best player -- his record eighth trophy.
The league is definitely looking forward -- no pun intended -- to a full season of Messi in 2024.
Buffalo Bills players kneel to pray as the ambulance carrying teammate Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin leaves the playing field during the first quarter against the Cincinnati Bengals at Paycor Stadium, on Jan. 2, 2023, in Cincinnati, Ohio.
Joseph Maiorana/USA TODAY Sports, FILE
Many of the moments on this list are light-hearted, but reality came crashing into the sports world just a few days into 2023 when Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin collapsed during a prime-time game with the Kansas City Chiefs. We would later learn that the then-24-year-old had suffered cardiac arrest and needed to be resuscitated with CPR on the field. A hush fell over the stadium as millions watched on TV hoping for the best. Thankfully, Hamlin made a speedy recovery as the sports world followed along with fingers crossed. He was even cleared to play again and played in several games in the fall.
In a repeat of the Hamlin collapse, LeBron James' son, Bronny, suffered cardiac arrest during a basketball practice at USC in July. The elite recruit also needed to be rushed to a nearby hospital and has made a full recovery. Like Hamlin, he's been cleared to play and has appeared in some games already during his freshman season.

You couldn't write a story more emblematic of the New York Jets than their newly signed franchise quarterback getting hurt four plays into the season -- and yet our jaws still were agape when Aaron Rodgers tore his Achilles on the first drive against the Buffalo Bills. Even non-Jets fans felt a little bad for them -- or would have if Rodgers wasn't so unlikable. As far as build-up to a big moment, followed by a complete and utter thud, you couldn't find a better (worse?) example.
And then Rodgers spent all season teasing Jets fans with a possible return, before eventually calling it quits after the team slipped out of playoff contention. Let's do it all again next fall -- if he doesn't threaten to retire again.

There's nothing like watching a young couple in love. Everywhere. At all times. Inescapably. Like, right now, in this story you are reading. Maybe because there's been so much darkness in the world lately -- two ongoing wars, endless politically charged legal wrangling, mass shootings, etc. -- nothing captured the world's attention like Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's romance. It was also the perfect crossover because it attracted two very different fanbases.
Sure, the endless cutaways to Swift in the crowd were a little annoying for true football fans, but it's harmless in the long run. She likes football now! And so do you! I mean, he is having one of the worst seasons of his career, but he's distracted. It's not all about your fantasy team.

The 2024 Summer Olympics (French: Les Jeux Olympiques d'été de 2024), officially the Games of the XXXIII Olympiad (French: Jeux de la XXXIIIe olympiade de l'ère moderne) and branded as Paris 2024, were an international multi-sport event held from 26 July to 11 August 2024 in France, with several events started from 24 July. Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities comprised of metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]
Paris was awarded the Games at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru, on 13 September 2017. After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of the 1924 games and the 1924 Winter Olympics in Chamonix (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Paris 2024 featured the debut of breaking as an Olympic sport,[7] and was the final Olympic Games held during the IOC presidency of Thomas Bach.[8] The 2024 Games were expected to cost €9 billion.[9][10][11] The opening ceremony was held outside of a stadium for the first time in modern Olympic history, being outdoors in the Paris's downtown and with as athletes were paraded by boat along the Seine. Paris 2024 was the first Olympics in history to reach full gender parity on the field of play, with equal numbers of male and female athletes.[12]
The United States topped the medal table for the fourth consecutive Summer Games and 19th time overall, with 40 gold and 126 total medals.[13] China tied with the United States on gold (40), but finished second due to having fewer silvers; the nation won 91 medals overall. This is the first time a gold medal tie among the two most successful nations has occurred in Summer Olympic history.[14] Japan finished third with 20 gold medals and sixth in the overall medal count. Australia finished fourth with 18 gold medals and fifth in the overall medal count. The host nation, France, finished fifth with 16 gold and 64 total medals, and fourth in the overall medal count. Dominica, Saint Lucia, Cape Verde and Albania won their first-ever Olympic medals, the former two both being gold, with Botswana and Guatemala also winning their first-ever gold medals. The Refugee Olympic Team also won their first-ever medal, a bronze in boxing.
Despite some controversies throughout relating to politics, logistics and conditions in the Olympic Village, the games were considered a success by the press, Parisians and observers upon its conclusion.[a] The Paris Olympics broke all-time records for ticket sales, with more than 9.5 million tickets sold (12.1 million including the Paralympic Games).[15]
Having previously hosted the 1900 and 1924 Games, Paris did not attempt to host the Olympics again until it bid, unsuccessfully, for the 1992 Games which were awarded to Barcelona. Subsequent bids for the 2008 and 2012 Games were also unsuccessful, as they were awarded to Beijing and London, respectively. Undeterred, Paris decided to bid once more for the 2024 edition, which would mark the centenary of its last Games.
The six candidate cities were Paris, Hamburg, Boston, Budapest, Rome, and Los Angeles. The bidding process was slowed by withdrawals, political uncertainty, and rising costs. Boston surpassed Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC, for the official U.S. bid. On 27 July 2015, Boston and the USOC mutually agreed to terminate Boston's bid to host the Games, partly because of mixed feelings among city residents. Hamburg withdrew its bid on 29 November 2015 after holding a referendum.[16] Rome withdrew on 21 September 2016, citing fiscal difficulties.[17] Budapest withdrew on 22 February 2017, after a petition against the bid collected more signatures than necessary for a referendum.[18][19][20]
Following these withdrawals, the IOC Executive Board met on 9 June 2017 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss the 2024 and 2028 bid processes.[21][22] The International Olympic Committee formally proposed electing the 2024 and 2028 Olympic host cities at the same time, a proposal which an Extraordinary IOC Session approved on 11 July 2017 in Lausanne.[22] The IOC set up a process whereby the LA 2024 and Paris 2024 bid committees met with the IOC to discuss which city would host the Games in 2024 and 2028 and whether it was possible to select the host cities for both at the same time.[23]
Following the decision to award the two Games simultaneously, Paris was understood to be the preferred host for 2024. On 31 July 2017, the IOC announced Los Angeles as the sole candidate for 2028,[24][25] enabling Paris to be confirmed as host for 2024. Both decisions were ratified at the 131st IOC Session on 13 September 2017.[26]
Paris was elected as the host city on 13 September 2017 at the 131st IOC Session in Lima, Peru. The two French IOC members, Guy Drut and Tony Estanguet, were ineligible to vote under the rules of the Olympic Charter.[27][28]
Location of the facilities in the Paris area
Most of the Olympic events were held in the city of Paris and its metropolitan region, including the neighbouring cities of Saint-Denis, Le Bourget, Nanterre, Versailles, and Vaires-sur-Marne.[29][30]
The basketball preliminaries and handball finals were held in Lille, 225 km (140 mi) from the host city, Paris; the sailing and some of the football games were held in the Mediterranean city of Marseille, which is 777 km (483 mi) from Paris; meanwhile, the surfing events were held in Teahupo'o village in the overseas territory of Tahiti, French Polynesia, which is 15,716 km (9,765 mi) from Paris. Football was also hosted in an additional five cities: Bordeaux, Décines-Charpieu (Lyon), Nantes, Nice and Saint-Étienne, some of which are home to Ligue 1 clubs.
The president of the Paris 2024 Olympic Organizing Committee, Tony Estanguet, unveiled the Olympic and Paralympic medals for the Games in February 2024, which on the obverse featured embedded hexagon-shaped tokens of scrap iron that had been taken from the original construction of the Eiffel Tower, with the logo of the Games engraved into it.[41] Approximately 5,084 medals would be produced by the French mint Monnaie de Paris, and were designed by Chaumet, a luxury jewellery firm based in Paris.[42]
The reverse of the medals features Nike, the Greek goddess of victory, inside the Panathenaic Stadium which hosted the first modern Olympics in 1896. Parthenon and the Eiffel Tower can also be seen in the background on both sides of the medal.[43] Each medal weighs 455–529 g (16–19 oz), has a diameter of 85 mm (3.3 in) and is 9.2 mm (0.36 in) thick.[44] The gold medals are made with 98.8 percent silver and 1.13 percent gold, while the bronze medals are made up with copper, zinc, and tin.[45]
France reached an agreement with Europol and the UK Home Office to help strengthen security and ""facilitate operational information exchange and international law enforcement cooperation"" during the Games.[46] The agreement included a plan to deploy more drones and sea barriers to prevent small boats from crossing the Channel illegally.[47] The British Army would also provide support by deploying Starstreak surface-to-air missile units for air security.[48] To prepare for the Games, the Paris police held inspections and rehearsals in their bomb disposal unit, similar to their preparations for the 2023 Rugby World Cup at the Stade de France.[49]
As part of a visit to France by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, several agreements were signed between the two nations to enhance security for the Olympics.[50] In preparation for the significant security demands and counterterrorism measures, Poland pledged to contribute security troops, including sniffer dog handlers, to support international efforts aimed at ensuring the safety of the Games.[51][52] The Qatari Minister of Interior and Commander of Lekhwiya (the Qatari security forces) convened a meeting on 3 April 2024 to discuss security operations ahead of the Olympics, with officials and security leaders in attendance, including Nasser Al-Khelaifi and Sheikh Jassim bin Mansour Al Thani.[53] A week before the opening ceremony, the Lekhwiya were reported to have been deployed in Paris on 16 July 2024.[54]
In the weeks running up to the opening of the Paris Olympics, it was reported that police officers would be deployed from Belgium,[55] Brazil,[56] Canada (through the RCMP/OPS/CPS/SQ),[57][58][59] Cyprus,[60] the Czech Republic,[61] Denmark,[62] Estonia,[63][64] Finland,[65] Germany (through Bundespolizei[66][67]/NRW Police[68]),[69] India,[70][71] Ireland,[72] Italy,[73] Luxembourg,[74] Morocco,[75] Netherlands,[76] Norway,[58] Poland,[77] Portugal,[78] Slovakia,[79] South Korea,[80][81] Spain (through the CNP/GC),[82] Sweden,[83] the UAE,[84] the UK,[49] and the US (through the LAPD,[85] LASD,[86] NYPD,[87] and the Fairfax County Police Department[88]), with more than 40 countries providing police assistance to their French counterparts.[89][90]
Security concerns impacted the plans that had been announced for the opening ceremony, which was to take place as a public event along the Seine; the expected attendance was reduced by half from an estimated 600,000 to 300,000, with plans for free viewing locations now being by invitation only. In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[91][92][93] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[94]
Following the end of the Games, the national counterterrorism prosecutor, Olivier Christen, revealed that French authorities foiled three terror plots meant to attack the Olympic and Paralympic Games, resulting in the arrest of five suspects.[95]
To reduce the environmental impact and climate footprint of the Games,[96] the Olympic venues served twice as much plant-based food as was available in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016.[97] Vegan chicken nuggets and vegan hot dogs were served in place of the meat-based variety.[98] Venues for spectators served on average two-thirds plant-based meals. The Place de la Concorde, the venue that hosted the skateboarding, breakdancing and BMX events, only served plant-based food. The football stadiums served 40% plant-based food. About 30% of the meals served to athletes in the Olympic Village were plant-based.[99]
A prior estimate of 13 million meals were served at the Games;[96] with around 40,000 meals each day, 1,200 of those will be Michelin-starred.[98] Each day, a boulangerie will bake fresh baguettes and other breads.[100] A 3,500-seat restaurant was constructed for the Games to highlight global cuisine. Great Britain's team asked for porridge to be added to the menu, and South Korea's team asked for kimchi.[98]
Throughout the Games, various athletes and competitors at the Olympic Village complained about certain foods within the accommodation such as eggs and grilled meats not being available in sufficient quantity.[101][102] British athletes also reportedly complained about raw meat being served, and the food issues led many of them to begin to avoid the Olympic Village dining facilities and to eat elsewhere; the British Olympic Association having flown in chefs to take care of the nourishment of British athletes at a location outside the Olympic Village.[102][103][104][105]
In the lead-up to the Games, it was announced that the Olympic Village would lack air conditioning; as an environmental measure, the buildings would instead use a geothermal natural cooling system to keep the inside temperature 6 °C (11 °F) cooler than outside.[106] On learning this, many teams opted to supply their own air-conditioning units to the Games, including Canada, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Japan, and the US.[107] Olympic delegations from poorer countries, such as Uganda, complained that they could not afford to provide air conditioning for their athletes.[108]
Over €500 million was invested in transport improvements for the Games,[109] with extensions to the Paris Métro and 60 kilometres (37 mi) of new cycle lanes.[110][111] Visitors to Paris paid higher public transport fares during the Games, €4 instead of the previous €2.15 price. This paid for the increased frequency and hours of service for public transport during the Games, with an average increase of 15% in services.[109][112] As with previous Games, 185 kilometres (115 mi) of reserved traffic lanes was used to ensure reliable journey times for athletes, officials and the media.[113]
The Paris 2024 volunteer platform for the Olympic and Paralympic Games was opened to the public in March 2023. There were expected to be 45,000 volunteers recruited worldwide for the Games.[114] Following the end of registration on 3 May 2023, over 300,000 applications had been submitted to the Paris Organising Committee, exceeding the number of applicants for the previous two Olympics.[115] Applicants were notified of the outcome of their application between September and December 2023.[116] Over 800 applicants were excluded over security fears, among which 15 were flagged with Fiche S.[117]
The Olympic torch relay began with the lighting of the Olympic flame on 16 April in Olympia, Greece, 100 days before the start of the Games. Greek rower Stefanos Douskos was the first torchbearer and swimmer Laure Manaudou served as the first French torchbearer.[118][119] The latter was selected to be one of four captains of the torch relay, alongside swimmer Florent Manaudou (her brother), paratriathlete Mona Francis, and para-athlete Dimitri Pavadé.[120][121] The torch relay was expected to have 10,000 torchbearers and visit over 400 settlements in 65 French territories, including six overseas.[118] On 18 May, it was reported that the portion of the relay in New Caledonia was cancelled due to ongoing unrest in the collectivity.[122]
9.5 million of the 10 million tickets available for the games were sold.  Several sports reported record attendance.[123]
The opening ceremony began at 19:30 CEST (17:30 GMT) on 26 July 2024.[124] Directed by Thomas Jolly,[125][126][127] it was the first Summer Olympics opening ceremony to be held outside the traditional stadium setting (and the second ever after the 2018 Youth Olympic Games one, held at Plaza de la República in Buenos Aires); the parade of athletes was conducted as a boat parade along the Seine from Pont d'Austerlitz to Pont d'Iéna, and cultural segments took place at various landmarks along the route.[128] Jolly stated that the ceremony would highlight notable moments in the history of France, with an overall theme of love and ""shared humanity"".[128] The athletes then attended the official protocol at Jardins du Trocadéro, in front of the Eiffel Tower.[129] Approximately 326,000 tickets were sold for viewing locations along the Seine, 222,000 of which were distributed primarily to the Games' volunteers, youth and low-income families, among others.[130]
The ceremony featured music performances by American musician Lady Gaga,[131] French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, heavy metal band Gojira and soprano Marina Viotti,[132] Axelle Saint-Cirel (who sang the French national anthem ""La Marseillaise"" atop the Grand Palais),[133] rapper Rim'K,[134] Philippe Katerine (who portrayed the Greek god Dionysus), Juliette Armanet and Sofiane Pamart, and was closed by Canadian singer Céline Dion.[132] The Games were formally opened by president Emmanuel Macron.[135]
The Olympics and Paralympics cauldron was lit by Guadeloupean judoka Teddy Riner and sprinter Marie-José Pérec; it had a hot air balloon-inspired design topped by a 30-metre-tall (98 ft) helium sphere, and was allowed to float into the air above the Tuileries Garden at night. For the first time, the cauldron was not illuminated through combustion; the flames were simulated by an LED lighting system and aerosol water jets.[136]
Controversy ensued at the opening ceremony when a segment was interpreted by some as a parody of the Last Supper. The organisers apologised for any offence caused.[137] The Olympic World Library and fact-checkers would later debunk the interpretation that the segment was a parody of the Last Supper. The Olympic flag was also raised upside down.[138][139]
During the day of the opening ceremony, there were reports of a blackout in Paris, although this was later debunked.[140]
The programme of the 2024 Summer Olympics featured 329 events in 32 sports, encompassing a total of 48 disciplines.[141] This included the 28 ""core"" Olympic sports contested in 2016 and 2020,[142] and 4 optional sports that were proposed by the Paris Organising Committee: breakdancing made its Olympic debut as an optional sport, while skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing returned to the programme, having debuted at the 2020 Summer Olympics.[143][144][145] Four events were dropped from weightlifting. In canoeing, two sprint events were replaced with two slalom events, keeping the overall event total at 16. In sport climbing, the previous ""combined"" event was divided into two separate disciplines: speed climbing, and boulder-and-lead.[146]
When Paris was bidding for the Games in August 2017, the Paris Organising Committee announced an intention to hold talks with the IOC and professional esports organisations about the possibility of introducing competitive esports events in 2024.[147][148] In July 2018, the IOC confirmed that esports would not be considered for the 2024 Olympics.[144] At the 134th IOC Session in June 2019, the IOC approved the Paris Organising Committee's proposed optional sports of breaking (breakdance), along with skateboarding, sport climbing, and surfing, three sports that were first included in 2020.[149][143][144][145]
In the 2024 Paris Olympics, several new events and formats have been introduced. Formula Kite made its debut, described as the ""Formula One of the Olympics"", featuring high-speed foil racing with separate events for men and women.[150] Kayak cross also debuted, where four athletes race against each other on a course with multiple gates, marking the first head-to-head race in Olympic canoe slalom history. Sport climbing returned with a new format, splitting into bouldering and lead combined events in addition to a speed event. 3x3 basketball, which debuted in Tokyo, was back with finals scheduled for August 5 at Place de La Concorde. Changes in other sports included the introduction of men's participation in artistic swimming, a new women's weight class in boxing, and the addition of a marathon race walk mixed relay in track and field.[151]
In addition to the Medalist Celebrations and the protocolar parts of the Opening Ceremonies, the Champions Park also received some medal reallocation ceremonies from previous Olympics dating back as far as 2000. Due to new IOC rules and protocols, one specific medal awarding ceremony was held in this venue figure skating team event from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. It had been the first Olympic medal ceremony to be delayed after Kamila Valieva from original gold medalist Russia was reported and then confirmed to have tested positive in 2021 for trimetazidine. In January 2024, the Court of Arbitration for Sport disqualified Valieva for four years retroactive to 25 December 2021 for an anti-doping rule violation, and the International Skating Union subsequently subtracted Valieva's scores, which upgraded the United States and Japan to gold and silver respectively.Under the IOC's new Medal Reallocation Rules, the IOC, the ISU, and the National Olympic Committees for both the United States and Japan coordinated this medal ceremony.There was thus trail maintenance used during Beijing 2022. However, both delegations for weather reasons were wearing their Paris 2024 uniforms.The Beijing 2022 soundtrack was still used for the medal ceremony, but both teams wore Paris 2024 national uniforms and it was the first medal ceremony from the 2022 Winter Olympics to have a full crowd, as there had been reduced audiences in 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[152][153][154][155][156][157]
The ceremony and final fireworks
The closing ceremony was held at Stade de France on 11 August 2024, and thus marked the first time in any Olympics  since Sarajevo 1984 that opening and closing ceremonies were held in different locations.[127] Titled ""Records"", the ceremony was themed around a dystopian future, where the Olympic Games have disappeared, and a group of aliens reinvent it. It featured more than a hundred performers, including acrobats, dancers and circus artists.[158] During the handover ceremonies, the American actor Tom Cruise also appeared with American performers Red Hot Chili Peppers, Billie Eilish, Snoop Dogg, and H.E.R. during the LA28 Handover Celebration portion of the ceremony.[159][160] The Antwerp Ceremony, in which the Olympic flag was handed to Los Angeles, the host city of the 2028 Summer Olympics, was produced by Ben Winston and his studio Fulwell 73.[161]
204 out of 206 National Olympic Committees are represented at the 2024 Summer Games with 54 from Africa, 48 from Europe, 44 from Asia, 41 from the Americas and 17 from Oceania. North Korea returned to the Games in 2024, after serving a cycle of suspension due to the ""boycott"" of the 2020 Summer Olympics. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the IOC suspended the Olympic Committees of Russia and Belarus for violating the Olympic Truce. Russian and Belarusian athletes instead competed as ""Individual Neutral Athletes"" (AIN) without national identification,[162][163] as long as they did not ""actively"" support the war.[164][165] Individual neutral athletes had to be approved by each sport's international federation, and then the IOC's panel.[166] As individual athletes, AIN was not considered a delegation during the opening ceremony or in the medal tables.[167][168][169] The Refugee Olympic Team also competed.

‡  Changes in medal standings (see below)
*   Host nation (France)
There was one podium sweep during the games:
The emblem for the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics was unveiled on 21 October 2019 at the Grand Rex. Inspired by Art Deco,[177][178] it is a representation of Marianne, the national personification of France, with a flame formed in negative space by her hair. The emblem also resembles a gold medal. Tony Estanguet explained that the emblem symbolised ""the power and the magic of the Games"", and the Games being ""for people"". The use of a female figure also serves as an homage to the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, which were the first to allow women to participate.[179] The emblem was designed by the French designer Sylvain Boyer[177] with the French design agencies Royalties & Ecobranding.[180][181][177]
The emblem for Paris 2024 was considered the biggest new logo release of 2019 by many design magazines.[177][182] An Opinion Way survey showed that 83 per cent of French people say they liked the new Paris 2024 Games emblem. Approval ratings were high, with 82 per cent of those surveyed finding it aesthetically appealing and 78 per cent finding it to be creative.[183] It was met with some mockery on social media, one user commenting that the logo ""would be better suited to a dating site or a hair salon"".[179]
For the first time, the corresponding Paralympics shared the same emblem as the Olympics, with no difference bar the governing bodies' logo, reflecting a shared ""ambition"" between both events.[184]
On 14 November 2022, the Phryges were unveiled as the mascots of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics; they are a pair of anthropomorphic Phrygian caps, a historic French symbol of freedom and liberty.[185][186] Marianne is commonly depicted wearing the Phrygian cap, including in the Eugène Delacroix painting, Liberty Leading the People.[187][188] The two mascots share a motto of ""Alone we go faster, but together we go further"".[189]
In April 2024, the official Olympic video game titled Olympics Go! Paris 2024 was announced for release in June by Animoca Brands on Android, iOS, and Microsoft Windows devices.[190][191] The 2024 Summer Olympics became the first Summer Olympics in over 30 years to not have an official console video game.[192][193]
The Olympic poster for these games was revealed on 4 March 2024. Designed by Ugo Gattoni, the poster uses a diptych design, with one half representing the Olympics and the other half representing the Paralympics. For the first time in Summer Games history, the Olympic poster and Paralympic poster were designed together, as each one can work independently as halves, or be combined into one poster all together. The posters took 2,000 hours, across six months to complete.[194][195]
A TGM Research survey found that Coca-Cola was globally the most connected brand with the 2024 Olympics, with 23% of people mentioning it. Nike came in second with 16%, despite not being an official sponsor of the Olympic Games.[196]
Belgian beverage company AB InBev became the first Worldwide Olympic Partner during the Games,[197] while five companies would not renew their sponsorships after 2024; automobile manufacturer Toyota, reportedly unhappy with how the IOC has used its sponsorship money, arguing that it is not effectively used to support athletes or promote sport;[198][199] Panasonic, under continuous management considerations regarding sponsorship, with the company also looking to expand its businesses outside consumer electronics;[200][201] and Bridgestone, with the company instead wanting to strengthen its motorsports division.[202][203] Atos and Intel let theirs lapse without a public announcement, with the earlier having its category covered by Deloitte from 2025.[204]
Under an agreement as ""Premium"" sponsor reportedly valued at €150 million ($163 million), French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH has been involved in aspects of the Games, with its brand Louis Vuitton having provided the trunks used to store the Olympic torch and medals, and the outfits and trays for medal presenters. Former IOC marketing head Michael Payne raised concerns that the prominent use of LVMH goods as part of the Olympics (and in particular, the opening ceremony, which also featured the aforementioned items as props, and performers Aya Nakamura and Lady Gaga wearing Dior haute couture) could cause conflicts with other official sponsors, noting that ""the direction of stylish sponsor product placement may not be wrong but needs exceptionally careful management. LVMH got a massive free global ad last night and other partners are all going to be asking, how did that work?""[205][206]
In France, domestic rights to the 2024 Summer Olympics were owned by Warner Bros. Discovery (formerly Discovery Inc.) via Eurosport, with free-to-air coverage sublicensed to the country's public broadcaster France Télévisions.[214] WBD networks will broadcast from Hôtel Raphael, with dedicated studios for its British, French, Polish, and Nordic channels.[215]
The official Olympics website offered both live-streaming and recent recordings of the events in selected markets, particularly in Brazil, Russia (due to Russian broadcasters pulling out), and the Indian subcontinent.[216]
Several controversial issues occurred related to the 2024 Summer Olympics, including environmental and security concerns,[217][218] human rights,[219] terrorism,[220] and controversies over allowing Israel to participate amidst the Gaza war,[221][222] and allowing Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete as neutrals amidst the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[223][224] While there is nominally an Olympic Truce in place as is usual, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and Israel–Hamas war set a more conflicted political background to the 2024 Summer Olympics, before considering domestic and sporting issues.[225]
A portion of the opening ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympics sparked significant controversy worldwide for its inclusion of a reenactment of the feast of the Gods, which depicts various Greek gods partaking in a banquet at Mount Olympus. The performance faced heavy backlash from Christian and conservative groups, who accused the performance representing the feast of Dionysus as mocking Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper.[226][227][228]
The artistic director of the ceremony, Thomas Jolly, the ceremony's creative team, and many art historians later confirmed that the performance was unrelated to Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper. Jolly additionally later stated, ""The idea was instead to have a grand pagan festival connected to the gods of Olympus, Olympism"".[229][230][231][232][233]
The Olympic World Library would later publish a media guide (written before the ceremony) describing it as being a homage to cultural festivities.[234] According to Georgian fact checking website Myth Detector, many experts had pointed out the differences between The Last Supper fresco and the performance.[235]
The performance, however, also received praise from others for ""celebrating queer visibility and LGBTQ+ inclusivity"", according to American magazine Cosmopolitan.[236] Among those who expressed appreciation for the segment were American actress Jodie Sweetin, as well as Le Filip, a Croatian-French drag queen who won the third season of Drag Race France.[237]",2692.0,14.630434782608695,0.07691796928561635,0.3203481714364066,13.75,864.0,4.695652173913044,38.15,14.0,15.3,13.29,16.6,9.43,31.0,56.52,14.0,384.5,2.1419019316493313,6.570950965824665,0.5323179791976226

International football competition
The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was the ninth edition of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the quadrennial international women's football championship contested by women's national teams and organised by FIFA. The tournament, which took place from 20 July to 20 August 2023, was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand.[2][3][4] It was the first FIFA Women's World Cup with more than one host nation, as well as the first World Cup to be held across multiple confederations, as Australia is in the Asian confederation, while New Zealand is in the Oceanian confederation. It was also the first Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere.[5]
This tournament was the first to feature an expanded format of 32 teams from the previous 24, replicating the format used for the men's World Cup from 1998 to 2022.[2] The opening match was won by co-host New Zealand, beating Norway at Eden Park in Auckland on 20 July 2023 and achieving their first Women's World Cup victory.[6]
Spain were crowned champions after defeating reigning European champions England 1–0 in the final. It was the first time a European nation had won the Women's World Cup since 2007 and Spain's first title, although their victory was marred by the Rubiales affair.[7][8][9] Spain became the second nation to win both the women's and men's World Cup since Germany in the 2003 edition.[10] In addition, they became the first nation to concurrently hold the FIFA women's U-17, U-20, and senior World Cups.[11] Sweden would claim their fourth bronze medal at the Women's World Cup while co-host Australia achieved their best placing yet, finishing fourth.[12] Japanese player Hinata Miyazawa won the Golden Boot scoring five goals throughout the tournament. Spanish player Aitana Bonmatí was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball, whilst Bonmatí's teammate Salma Paralluelo was awarded the Young Player Award. England goalkeeper Mary Earps won the Golden Glove, awarded to the best-performing goalkeeper of the tournament.
Of the eight teams making their first appearance, Morocco were the only one to advance to the round of 16 (where they lost to France; coincidentally, the result of this fixture was similar to the men's World Cup in Qatar, where France defeated Morocco in the semi-final). The United States were the two-time defending champions,[13] but were eliminated in the round of 16 by Sweden, the first time the team had not made the semi-finals at the tournament, and the first time the defending champions failed to progress to the quarter-finals.[14]
Australia's team, nicknamed the Matildas, performed better than expected, and the event saw many Australians unite to support them.[15][16][17] The Matildas, who beat France to make the semi-finals for the first time, saw record numbers of fans watching their games, their 3–1 loss to England becoming the most watched television broadcast in Australian history, with an average viewership of 7.13 million and a peak viewership of 11.15 million viewers.[18]
It was the most attended edition of the competition ever held.[19]
The FIFA Women's World Cup is a professional association football (soccer) tournament contested by senior women's national football teams, organised by FIFA.[20] The tournament, held every four years and one year after the men's World Cup, was first played in 1991 in China, and was expanded to 32 teams beginning with the 2023 edition. The tournament is contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams. The defending champions were the United States, who defeated the Netherlands 2–0 in the 2019 final.[21][13] The event took place over a period of a month, from 20 July to 20 August, in Australia and New Zealand. This Women's World Cup was the first co-hosted tournament, and also the first senior World Cup to be held across multiple confederations. In addition, it was the first senior tournament to be held in Oceania, the first Women's World Cup in the Southern Hemisphere, and the third to be held in the Asia-Pacific region, after 1991 and 2007.
The match schedule was announced by FIFA on 1 December 2021,[22][23] with kick-off times confirmed on 24 October 2022, two days after the final draw.[24][25]
The opening match of the tournament, between co-host New Zealand and Norway, was played on 20 July 2023 at Eden Park. The inaugural match played in Australia, was between Australia playing against the Republic of Ireland on the same day at Stadium Australia, after a venue change due to strong ticketing demand.[26]
The total prize pool was USD 110 million, $80 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[27]
At previous tournaments, FIFA paid total prize money to the national associations, but for the 2023 Women's World Cup it was set to award prize payments directly to players as well as the associations. This came as a result of reports in the women's game that a number of national associations were withholding competition prize money from players and/or not paying them at all.[27] In March 2023, global player union FIFPRO sent a letter signed by players from around the world to FIFA, challenging FIFA to make prize money in the men's and women's tournaments equal and to ensure at least 30% of prize money in the women's tournament made it to the players. While FIFA did not match the prize money of the men's tournament, it did significantly increase it, with more than half set to be paid to players directly.[28]
Just before the tournament, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced that the player payments would still be paid to the associations, and that FIFA planned to audit the associations to make sure the money got to the players. Football administrator Lise Klaveness expressed concern over what she felt sounded like reneging on the promise, both for the players and for FIFA's credibility.[29] During the tournament, Infantino admitted that FIFA had simply made recommendations to associations on how much to pay players, and they could not reasonably check.[30]
Bidding began for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup on 19 February 2019.[31] Member associations interested in hosting the tournament had to submit a declaration of interest by 15 March, and provide the completed bidding registration by 16 April. However, FIFA revised the bidding timeline as the tournament expanded to 32 teams on 31 July.[32] Other member associations interested in hosting the tournament then had until 16 August to submit a declaration of interest, while the completed bidding registration of new member associations and re-confirmation of prior bidders was due by 2 September.[33]
Nine countries initially indicated interest in hosting the events: Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Japan, South Korea (with interest in a joint bid with North Korea), New Zealand and South Africa.[34] Belgium expressed interest in hosting the tournament following the new deadline but later dropped out, as did Bolivia, in September 2019.[35][36] Australia and New Zealand later announced they would merge their bids in a joint submission.[37] Brazil, Colombia, and Japan joined them in submitting their bid books to FIFA by 13 December.[38] However, both Brazil and Japan later withdrew their bids in June 2020 before the final voting.[39][40]
On 25 June 2020, Australia and New Zealand won the bid to host the Women's World Cup.[41] The decision came after a vote by the FIFA Council, with the winning bid earning 22 votes, while Colombia earned 13.[42] Neither country had previously hosted a senior FIFA tournament. This was the first Women's World Cup to be hosted in multiple countries, and only the second World Cup tournament to do so, following the 2002 FIFA World Cup, held in Japan and South Korea. It was also the first FIFA Women's World Cup to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first senior FIFA tournament to be held in Oceania, and the first FIFA tournament to be hosted across multiple confederations (with Australia in the AFC and New Zealand in the OFC). Australia became the second association from the AFC to host the Women's World Cup, after China in both 1991 and 2007.[43]
In July 2019, Infantino proposed an expansion of the Women's World Cup from 24 to 32 teams, starting with the 2023 edition, and doubling the tournament's prize money.[44] The proposal came following the success of the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup and the prior edition of the tournament in 2015, which after increasing from 16 to 24 teams set an attendance record for all FIFA competitions besides the men's FIFA World Cup.[45] Expanding the tournament to allow eight additional participating teams gave more member associations a greater opportunity to qualify for the final tournament. This fostered the growing reach and professionalisation of the women's game.[46]
On 31 July, the FIFA Council unanimously decided to expand the tournament to 32 teams, featuring eight groups of four.[32]
The astounding success of this year's FIFA Women's World Cup in France made it very clear that this is the time to keep the momentum going and take concrete steps to foster the growth of women's football. I am glad to see this proposal becoming a reality.
The tournament opened with a group stage consisting of eight groups of four teams, with the top two teams progressing from each group to a knockout tournament featuring 16 teams. The number of games played overall increased from 52 to 64. The tournament replicated the format of the men's FIFA World Cup used between 1998 and 2022. For the first time since the 2002 FIFA World Cup, both qualified teams from each group were kept on the same side of the draw in the knockout stage, meaning they could potentially meet again in the semi-final. This was to minimise travel between Australia and New Zealand and to ensure both host nations remained in their own country up to the semi-finals should they qualify.[47]

Locations of the host cities of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup
Australia and New Zealand proposed 13 possible venues across 12 host cities for the tournament in the bid book submitted to FIFA, suggesting a minimum of 10 stadiums be used—5 in each country.[48] The original proposal of the joint bid would have seen the venues divided into three main travel hubs: South Hub, containing Perth, Adelaide, Launceston and Melbourne; East Hub, containing Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne and Launceston; and New Zealand Hub, containing Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin. The Sydney Football Stadium was the only new stadium, undergoing a major renovation during the bid period, replacing the old football stadium on the same site and opening on 28 August 2022.[49]
The bid evaluation was released on 10 June 2020 by FIFA, which noted that the majority of the stadiums listed in the bid meet FIFA's hosting requirements with capacity, aside from Adelaide and Auckland, which did not meet the minimum requirements capacity wise for stages of the competition proposed for.[50] Most stadiums featured in the bid were planned to have minor renovations with new floodlighting, pitch renovations,[51] in addition to gender-neutral changing rooms in time for the tournament.[52]
On 31 March 2021, FIFA announced the final host city and venue selections. Five cities and six stadiums were used in Australia, along with four cities and stadiums in New Zealand. From the proposed venues, Newcastle and Launceston were not selected in Australia and Christchurch was omitted in New Zealand. Eden Park in Auckland hosted the opening game, with Stadium Australia in Sydney hosting the final match.[53][54] As a part of the branding, all cities used native names (Indigenous in Australia and Māori in New Zealand) alongside their English names in an effort to ""reconcile and respect the original owners of the land"".[55] They were: Tarntanya (Adelaide), Meanjin (written as Meaanjin; Brisbane), Naarm (Melbourne), Boorloo (Perth), Gadigal (Eastern Sydney; for Sydney Football Stadium), Wangal (Western Sydney; for Stadium Australia), Tāmaki Makaurau (Auckland), Ōtepoti (Dunedin), Kirikiriroa (Hamilton), and Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington).[56]
Eden Park, Auckland hosted New Zealand's opening match; Stadium Australia, Sydney hosted Australia's opening match (both group stages). Lang Park, Brisbane, hosted the third-place match on 19 August; Stadium Australia hosted the final which was held on 20 August.[57]
The Women's World Cup forced many domestic Australian sporting teams to move matches from grounds under the FIFA lockout, particularly those in the National Rugby League.[58]
Team base camps
Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the Women's World Cup tournament. FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for the 29 qualified participating nations on 11 December 2022, with the remaining 3 qualified teams selecting their base camps after the Play-off Tournament.[69] FIFA later confirmed the last remaining three base camps for the play-off tournament winners on 21 March 2023.[70] It was the first World Cup to have dedicated base camps for the 32 participating nations.[71]
FIFA's confederations organised their qualifications through continental championships, with the exception of UEFA which organised its own qualifying competition. Australia and New Zealand, as co-hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament, leaving the remaining 207 FIFA member associations eligible to enter qualification if they chose to do so. Australia competed at the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup, whilst New Zealand did not enter the OFC Women's Nations Cup the same year. The reigning Women's World Cup champions United States competed in qualification through the CONCACAF W Championship.[72][73]
The Chadian and Pakistani football associations were suspended by FIFA, thus excluding them from entering qualifications.[74] Rwanda, Sudan, DR Congo and São Tomé and Príncipe entered qualification but withdrew later.[75][76][77][78] Kenya withdrew before the second round of qualifiers.[79] North Korea and Turkmenistan withdrew from the Women's Asian Cup qualifiers due to safety concerns and travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[80] Iraq withdrew after the AFC draw.[81] Due to the uncertainty of women's sport after the Taliban takeover of the country, Afghanistan withdrew from qualification.[82] Due to COVID-19 pandemic outbreaks in their squads, Women's Asian Cup hosts India withdrew from qualification.[83] American Samoa withdrew due to continuing difficulties related to the pandemic.[84] Russia were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[85]
The allocation of slots for each confederation was confirmed by the FIFA Council on 25 December 2020. The slots for the two host nations were taken directly from the quotas allocated to their confederations.[86]
A ten-team play-off tournament decided the final three spots at the Women's World Cup. The play-off slot allocation was as follows:[87][88]
Of the 32 nations qualified for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2019. Haiti, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Vietnam and Zambia made their debuts at the FIFA Women's World Cup. This World Cup was the first FIFA tournament the Philippines played in. This was Panama, Portugal and Vietnam's first FIFA women's competition, having only taken part in various FIFA men's tournaments. Zambia made history as the first landlocked country in Africa to qualify for a World Cup for either sex. Morocco became the first-ever Arab country to qualify for the Women's World Cup, while the Republic of Ireland marked their debut at any senior women's tournament. Denmark made their first appearance in 16 years after missing three consecutive tournaments, their last appearance being in 2007. Costa Rica, Colombia and Switzerland returned to the tournament after missing the previous one in 2019. Italy qualified for two consecutive women's World Cups for the first time in their history, after three sporadic appearances in 1991, 1999 and 2019.[89][88] Africa had four representatives for the first time in the competition's history.[90]
Thailand, Cameroon, Chile, and Scotland, all of whom qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup, did not qualify for the 2023 tournament. Iceland was the highest ranked team in the FIFA Women's World Rankings that failed to qualify, ranked 16th at the time.[A] Zambia were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 81st at the time.[91]
The qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Women's World Ranking before the tournament were:[92]
Team qualified
Team failed to qualify
Team withdrew or suspended
Did not enter
Each team had to provide to FIFA a preliminary squad of between 35 and 55 players, which FIFA did not publish. From the preliminary squad, each team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by 9 July 2023. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.[93]
The final draw took place at the Aotea Centre in Auckland, New Zealand, on 22 October 2022 at 19:30 NZDT (UTC+13), prior to the completion of qualification.[94][95] The three winners of the inter-confederation play-off were not known at the time of the draw.[96]
Retired American international and two-time Women's World Cup winner Carli Lloyd and CNN International sports presenter Amanda Davies conducted the draw. Each confederation had a retired international representing them as a draw assistant: Maia Jackman of New Zealand for the OFC and Julie Dolan of Australia for the AFC, alongside men's internationals Ian Wright of England for UEFA, Alexi Lalas of the United States for CONCACAF, Geremi of Cameroon for the CAF and 2002 World Cup winner Gilberto Silva of Brazil for CONMEBOL. Snowboarding Olympic gold medalist Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand and four-time swimming Olympic gold medalist Cate Campbell of Australia also assisted the draw.[97]
For the draw, the 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Women's World Rankings of 13 October 2022. Pot one contained both co-hosts New Zealand and Australia (both automatically placed in positions A1 and B1, respectively) along with the best six teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams being allocated into the following pot (pot three). Pot four contained the lowest ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the three inter-confederation play-off winners. With the exception of UEFA, teams from the same confederation could not be drawn in the same group. However, since each inter-confederation play-off group contained multiple confederations, the placeholders were identified by the seeded teams in their respective play-off pathways to avoid any draw constraints. The draw started with pot one and ended with pot four, with the team selected being allocated to the first available group alphabetically. Pot 1 teams were automatically drawn to position 1 of each group, with the following positions drawn for the remaining pots. The pots for the draws are shown below.[98]
In January 2023, the FIFA Referees Committee announced the list of 33 referees, 55 assistant referees, and 19 video assistant referees (VAR) for the tournament. Of the 33 referees, FIFA included 2 each from Australia, Canada, South Korea, and the United States.[99]
France's Stéphanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan, who became the first female referees to officiate the men's World Cup in 2022, were among those selected for the Women's World Cup. They were also joined by female assistant referees Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina, who also participated at the men's tournament.[99]
Heba Saadieh became the first Palestinian and Arab female referee to officiate at a World Cup of either gender. Firas Abu Hilal, secretary general of the Palestinian Football Association labelled Saadia as ""a role model for Palestinian women who aspire to achieve success and greatness"" and that she ""has proven the ability of Palestinian women to excel in any field"".[100][101]
The VAR at the tournament had the spoken explanations broadcast in the stadium and on television as part of a year-long trial of the technique intended to give more transparency to often-controversial decisions. Other sports with video referees already used the measure, with FIFA also having implemented it at the 2022 FIFA Club World Cup and 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.[102]
On 18 August 2023, FIFA announced that American referee Tori Penso would adjudicate the final at Stadium Australia.[103]
There were two opening ceremonies, one before each kick-off game in the two host nations on 20 July 2023.[104] The first took place at Eden Park, Auckland, ahead of the opening game of the competition between New Zealand and Norway.[105] The ceremonies both featured indigenous welcomes, fireworks, dancing and live music, before a moment of silence.[104] A few hours before the opening ceremony, a shooting occurred in downtown Auckland during which three people, including the assailant, were killed. A moment of silence was held for the attack victims.[106]
The Eden Park ceremony was noted to be very brief.[105] It began with Māori and indigenous Australian artists;[105] colour and culture representing the indigenous people featured in the ceremony, with a haka being performed as well.[107] There was a dance with groups of dancers representing each nation competing at the tournament, and a montage of star players from all the participants.[105] To close the ceremony,[105] New Zealand singer Benee and Australian singer Mallrat performed the tournament's official song, ""Do It Again"".[107]
At Stadium Australia, Sydney, Indigenous Australian artists performed.[104]
The tournament's closing ceremony took place at Stadium Australia, Sydney, on 20 August 2023, ahead of the Final. The ceremony featured a Welcome to Country, and a performance from Australian singer Tones and I.[108]
There was also an extended pre-game ceremony featuring a Māori poi performance prior to the first semi-final at Eden Park, Auckland as it was the final match to be held in New Zealand.[109]
The performance of the Australian national women's team (nicknamed ""the Matildas"") greatly increased public interest in the sport. Amidst the tournament, FIFA said ""football is the only subject on everyone's lips"" in the nation, having an ""enormous impact"" on the Australian public.[110] The outpouring of support for the team was dubbed ""Matildas fever"" by the media.[111] Writing for The Guardian, former professional soccer player Craig Foster said: ""We are not so much watching a national team compete, as a changing nation at play,"" citing the Matildas' performance for ""overturn[ing] misconceptions of women's sport"" and inspiring young women.[112]
Australian TV broadcast viewership records were broken multiple times, with 11.15 million watching the Matildas' match against England on the Seven Network.[113] Live viewing sites were set up in cities around the country,[114] with major stadiums being used to show the match in Sydney to cope with massive crowds.[115] The Australian government pledged $200 million to improve women's sporting facilities as a direct result of the team's success.[116]
The success of the tournament and the high viewership increased support for Australia and New Zealand to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup.[117] The tournament netted NZ$109.5 million to New Zealand's economy, which was more than double the projected $46.3 million.[118]
New Zealand Football have already stated a 25% increase in girls and women playing football occurred in New Zealand as of 2023, with more expected to play in 2024, the first full season after the conclusion of the tournament.[119] The tournament has also left its effect on the New Zealand community, with 30 sports venues receiving upgrades for the tournament.[120]
The group stage was played from 20 July to 3 August. Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.[121]
In the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each). If the score was still level after extra time, the winners were determined by a penalty shoot-out.[121]
The following World Cup awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament: the Golden Boot (top scorer), Golden Ball (best overall player) and Golden Glove (best goalkeeper)[122]
Additionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Colombia's Linda Caicedo for her goal in the group stage match against Germany.[123]
There were 164 goals scored in 64 matches, for an average of 2.56 goals per match.

The following suspensions were served during the tournament:
The official emblem was jointly designed by Toronto-based studio Public Address and Los Angeles-based Works Creative Agency and unveiled on 28 October 2021 during a live show. The emblem featured a football encircled by 32 coloured squares, reflecting the expanded field of the tournament, and the natural terrains of the two host nations. The overall branding of the tournament featured designs reflecting the host nations' Indigenous peoples, created by Australian Kalkatungu artist Chern'ee Sutton and Māori artist Fiona Collis. Furthermore, the tournament's branding also incorporated the native names of all host cities. Alongside the emblem, the official slogan of the tournament, ""Beyond Greatness"", reflected FIFA's goal for the event to further expand the prominence of women's football, was also revealed.[124][125] The names of the host cities in their native names (the local Australian Aboriginal languages and Māori in New Zealand) were used as part of the official branding.[55]
Approximately 1.4 million tickets were sold or distributed by 19 July 2023, setting a new tournament record. Sluggish sales in New Zealand resulted in 20,000 free tickets being issued by sponsor Xero.[126][127][128]
FIFA 23 featured the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup mode; the video game update was released on 27 June 2023, replicating the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup tournament and featuring the 32 qualified teams.[129][130]
The 2023 Women's World Cup was the first Women's World Cup to have its broadcasting rights sold as a standalone product rather than being packaged as a bonus of purchasing broadcasting rights for the Men's World Cup. FIFA stated that they saw ""huge interest"" in the separate bidding process and hoped for more regional partners to sign on. FIFA set an aim to reach a global audience of 2 billion, up from 1.12 billion at the previous edition of the tournament in France.[131]
In October 2022, FIFA rejected multiple bids from various public and private broadcasters for what it described as significantly under-priced bids, urging broadcasters to bid more, saying it is what the women's game deserves.[132] Some European broadcasters were concerned about the timezone difference affecting viewership figures, something that was not an issue with the France-hosted 2019 Women's World Cup, while Gianni Infantino threatened a media blackout for Europe's ""big five"" (United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain) if they did not offer more.[133] The issue was resolved by the middle of June 2023, five weeks before the tournament, with all territories having deals.[134] A deal between Japanese broadcaster NHK and FIFA was announced for the last uncovered major market a week before start of the tournament.[135]
The tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 19 October 2022. The mascot's name is Tazuni, which is a portmanteau of the Tasman Sea and ""Unity"".[165] She is a little penguin (Eudyptula minor[165]), endemic to New Zealand — FIFA incorrectly stated this penguin (E. minor) was endemic in Australia, where a closely related species (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) was described as new and distinct in 2016.[166]
On 24 January 2023, The word ""Oceaunz"" was unveiled as the official match ball for the tournament by Adidas.[167]
Oceaunz's design was inspired by the unique natural landscapes of the two host nations, with visuals nodding to the vast mountains of New Zealand and Australia's connection with the Indian Ocean. Its name was a portmanteau based on the tournament's geographical location: Oceania, Australia, and New Zealand. Oceaunz featured the same connected ball technology as was seen in Qatar at the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This provided precise ball data, which was made available to video assistant referees in real-time.[167] It was previously used at the 2023 FIFA U-20 World Cup.
The match ball for the semi-finals, third place match, and final, the Oceaunz Final Pro, was revealed on 14 August 2023. It differed from the regular Oceaunz with an orange and gold colouration, reflecting the sunsets across the Sydney skyline, where the final was held.[168]
There were several official songs for the 2023 Women's World Cup. The official theme song, ""Unity"" by British DJ and music producer Kelly Lee Owens, was released on 28 October 2021 at the same time as the official emblem and slogan unveiling.[169] An instrumental song with non-lyric vocals, it was played at half-time of every match.[170] On 29 June 2023, the official song of the tournament, ""Do It Again"" by New Zealand singer Benee and Australian singer Mallrat, and its lyric video were released.[171][172] In July 2023, the ""official walk-out track"" for the matches at the tournament was revealed to be ""Bring It On"" by Australian singer Tones and I, American rapper BIA and French-Senegalese singer-songwriter Diarra Sylla.[173]
Other songs were independently produced for the tournament. The Nike player commercials ""Let It Rip"", depicting Megan Rapinoe as an All-American Hero,[174][175][176] and ""Like a Lioness"", showcasing the England team, featured original songs. The latter (also called ""Like a Lioness"") was performed by Ms Banks,[177] who had previously performed the theme song of the BBC's coverage of the 2019 Women's World Cup.[178] A supergroup of female artists, Hope FC, also released ""Call Me a Lioness"", an anthemic song inspired by the England team (better known as the Lionesses). Hope FC featured British musicians including Melanie C, Self Esteem, Alex Greenwood of Sports Team, Olivia Dean, Ellie Rowsell of Wolf Alice, and Shura (a former youth player herself).[179][180][181]
Football Australia CEO James Johnson indicated early on in planning that displaying flags representing Indigenous Australians and Indigenous New Zealanders was important to the host nations, and were discussing with FIFA whether this would be permitted at the same time as they and others were discussing captain's armbands.[182] A captain's armband highlighting rights for Indigenous peoples was approved by FIFA in June 2023,[183] with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags (Australian Aboriginal flag and Torres Strait Islander flag), and New Zealand Māori flag (Tino Rangatiratanga) approved in July 2023. The extended wait for approval, especially after the armband decision had been announced, prompted Football Australia to seek further clarification. FIFA permitted the relevant flags to be flown alongside the national flags of Australia and New Zealand at all venues, giving them the same prominent status upon recommendation from Indigenous consultants and the governments of both host nations.[184][185] Previously, the Australia team displaying the Aboriginal flag before matches had caused controversy.[186]
In a sign of respect for the traditional custodians of the land, indigenous names for the host cities were used alongside the English names in branding.[55]
On 13 July 2023, a group of 44 players, led by Denmark's Sofie Junge Pedersen and facilitated by Common Goal and Football for Future, announced that they would combat the carbon footprint of the teams' flights to Australia and New Zealand by donating to ""climate resilience and carbon offsetting initiatives"" organised by the World Wildlife Fund and DanChurchAid.[187] Having donated to offset carbon emissions every time her team required flights for five years before the 2023 Women's World Cup,[182] Junge Pedersen decided to reach out to her national and club teammates to do the same when faced with the long flights to Australia and New Zealand and the prominence of the tournament. Announcing the initiative, she hoped other players would join them in donating before and during the World Cup. She and Canada's Jessie Fleming discussed their hope to leave a positive environmental impact, acknowledging that the donations were short-term fixes for one issue, and their hope that there will be more climate-positive developments in football.[187][182]
The group of players also petitioned football governing bodies to make carbon concerns a more important factor in the bidding processes for future tournaments.[188] The initiative was considered the biggest player-led climate campaign in football, especially with the 44 players coming from a variety of nations and working together. The player donations were also matched by a third party.[189]
Also facilitated by Common Goal, the Germany team announced before their opening match that they would donate 1% of their FIFA-guaranteed earnings from the tournament to Futbalo Girls and Girl Power, grassroots football programmes for young girls and non-binary people.[190]
The day before the tournament began, UN Women announced that it had partnered with FIFA for the Women's World Cup ""to celebrate the skills and achievements of the teams and players, to advance gender equality in football, and to prevent abuse and discrimination on and off the field.""[191] The initiative was also to highlight gender inequality issues during the tournament, with a joint campaign for everyone to recognise gender equality as a fundamental human right and to call for an end to violence against women and girls.[191]
There were various controversies relating to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, with a main focus on players from a variety of teams going public about disputes with their respective football associations over various elements of professionalism, collective bargaining and development that they felt were not being met.[192]
There were also controversies reacting to unpopular decisions made by FIFA: player welfare was a concern;[193][194] the potential sponsorship of the tournament by Saudi Arabia was criticised and eventually dropped;[195] the amount of money that the Big Five bid for broadcasting rights was criticised by FIFA, which in turn was lambasted for hypocrisy;[196] and the inconsistency of the qualification system, in particular widespread condemnation by FIFPRO against confederations other than UEFA for failure to organise separate qualification campaigns unrelated to continental championships, was criticised.[197]
After FIFA experienced criticism for specifically banning OneLove captain's armbands hours before the 2022 Men's World Cup, it spent months in discussion with the women's teams to communicate on the matter. Both rainbow and OneLove armbands were banned at the Women's World Cup, with a similar FIFA-designed armband instead made available by the organisation.[198][199]
After Spain won the Women's World Cup, former Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) President Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed a Spanish footballer, Jenni Hermoso, and breached the Article 13 of FIFA Disciplinary Code. Rubiales was banned by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee from engaging in any football-related activities at both national and international level for three years.[200]
The opening match of the Women's World Cup took place in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July; on the morning of the match, a gunman killed multiple people in the Auckland CBD.[201] The fatal attack ""cast a shadow"" over the tournament.[202][203][204][205] Football Australia said the shooting was not motivated by the World Cup.[206] It took place near the hotel (M Social) where Norway, who played New Zealand in the opening match, were staying.[201] The FIFA Fan Festival which was scheduled to take place nearby to the shooting location was cancelled, while the Italy team, who were also staying in a nearby hotel, could not leave to attend training due to police cordons. NZ FIFA Head Office was also located and based in offices directly over the road from the shooting.[207][208] Moments of silence were observed on matchday one in respect to the victims of the shooting;[209][106] security at and around Eden Park, the location of the opening match in Auckland, was heightened, with a statement saying this measure was taken for ""reassurance"".[210][211] The players also wore black armbands[209] and stadium flags were flown at half mast for both opening games.[212] After New Zealand won the opening match in a surprise victory, Ali Riley paid tribute to the victims, saying that the team had ""wanted to bring something amazing"" in response to the shooting.[213]
Another fatal shooting in the Auckland CBD, on the same street, occurred on 3 August; considered an unrelated and isolated incident, one person was killed and the perpetrator fled the scene after a fight broke out.[214][215]
The New Zealand team's base camp was at the Pullman Auckland Hotel & Apartments. At 7:48 pm on 22 July, the players and staff had to evacuate after fires broke out in multiple locations around the hotel due to a suspected arson attack; they were later allowed to return. Four people were treated for smoke inhalation, while Fire and Emergency New Zealand deemed the incident suspicious.[216] New Zealand Football said that the fire was not connected to the shooting two days earlier. The security around the New Zealand team was increased,[217] and a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary and arson.[218][219]",3469.0,14.217213114754099,0.09777693704600475,0.37244967132679024,12.53,1035.0,4.241803278688525,38.66,13.8,14.8,12.83,15.9,8.1,23.0,55.18,13.0,477.38,2.0830210435283942,6.49264917843759,0.3940616892476218

Football match
The 2022 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 22nd edition of FIFA's competition for men's national football teams. The match was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, on 18 December 2022, the Qatari National Day, and was contested by Argentina and defending champions France. With a record 1.5 billion people watching on television, the final became one of the most widely watched televised sporting events in history.[3]
The tournament comprised hosts Qatar and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in Group C, first losing to Saudi Arabia 2–1, then defeating both Mexico and Poland 2–0. They then beat Australia 2–1 in the round of 16, the Netherlands in the quarter-final through a penalty shoot-out after it ended 2–2 in extra time, and Croatia in the semi-final 3–0. France finished first in Group D with two wins and one loss (4–1 win over Australia, 2–1 win over Denmark, and a 1–0 loss to Tunisia), defeating Poland 3–1 in the round of 16, England 2–1 in the quarter-final, and Morocco 2–0 in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 88,966 spectators and was refereed by Szymon Marciniak.
Argentina took the lead through a penalty by Lionel Messi in the 23rd minute before Ángel Di María further increased their lead in the 36th minute with a low shot into the corner of the goal after a sweeping Argentina counterattack. France failed to register a shot at the goal for the vast majority of the match until a 97-second brace by Kylian Mbappé tied the game 2–2 in the 81st minute. During extra time, Messi then scored again to give Argentina a 3–2 lead. However, Mbappé scored a second penalty to tie the game 3–3 with just a few minutes remaining, becoming the second man to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final after Geoff Hurst in 1966. Argentina then won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to win their third World Cup, and first since 1986.
It was the second time that Argentina reached the World Cup final after losing their opening match (the other occasion being in 1990), a feat three other teams have achieved (West Germany in 1982, Italy in 1994, and Spain in 2010); it was only the second time in history that a team went on to win the tournament after losing their opening match (following Spain in 2010). France became the first team in history to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose. Messi was named the man of the match and won the Golden Ball as FIFA's best player of the tournament.
The match was ranked by the football media  and fans alike as one of the greatest World Cup finals, and one of the greatest football matches in the history of the sport.[4][5]
Argentina had won the World Cup twice before, in 1978 and 1986.[6] They had also finished as losing finalists three times, in 1930, 1990 and 2014. After the 2014 final loss, they went on to lose two consecutive Copa América finals to Chile, in 2015 and 2016. After a string of disappointing performances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, where they lost to eventual champions France in the first knockout round, and the 2019 Copa América,[7] where they finished third, newly appointed coach Lionel Scaloni led Argentina to their first international title since 1993 by defeating title holders Brazil 1–0 in the 2021 Copa América final and handing captain Lionel Messi his first senior international title.[8][9] After winning the 2022 Finalissima, beating European champions Italy 3–0,[10] Argentina entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.[11][12]
France were the defending champions from the 2018 World Cup, which made this the first time since the 2002 final in which a team had consecutive appearances at the finals, and the first since 1998 in which the title holders qualified for the subsequent final – both feats achieved by Brazil. France had claimed two World Cups, in 1998 and 2018. The French also reached the 2006 final, but fell to Italy on penalties. Under the management of Didier Deschamps, who won the 1998 tournament as a player, the French failed to conquer the 2014 World Cup and UEFA Euros 2016 and 2020, but successfully clinched the 2018 World Cup title.[13][14] Due to their status as the world champions, France also entered Qatar as one of the favourites to win.[15] France aimed to emulate the achievement of Italy in 1934 and 1938 and Brazil in 1958 and 1962 as the third country to successfully defend the World Cup title. Deschamps was seeking to become the second manager to win two men's FIFA World Cup titles, after Vittorio Pozzo with Italy in 1934 and 1938.[16] Having won the 1998 tournament as a player, Deschamps was also seeking to become the third person to win three FIFA World Cup titles, after Brazilian legends Pelé (all as a player) and Mário Zagallo (two as a player, one as a manager).[17][18]
The two nations met in the knockout stage for the second straight World Cup. In 2018 in Russia at the Kazan Arena in the round of 16, France won the encounter 4–3 in what The Independent called ""one of the greatest World Cup games of all time"".[19] Antoine Griezmann opened the scoring with a penalty before Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado put Argentina in front, with France then scoring the next three goals courtesy of Benjamin Pavard's volley outside of the box – which was later voted as the goal of the tournament[20] – and then Kylian Mbappé twice.[21] Sergio Agüero reduced the deficit to one in stoppage time, but Argentina was unable to equalise and send the match to extra time.[22]
The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, third place match and final was announced on 11 December 2022. It was a variation of the Adidas Al Rihla used in the rest of the tournament named the Adidas Al-Hilm, meaning ""The Dream"" in Arabic, a reference to every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup.[23] Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design, a reference to the national colours of host nation Qatar and the golden colours shared by the final's venue Lusail Stadium and the FIFA World Cup Trophy. It is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the +Teamgeist Berlin,[24] Jo'bulani,[25] Brazuca Final Rio,[26] and Telstar Mechta.[27]
The final was played at Lusail Stadium in Lusail, Qatar, located about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) north of the city centre of Doha.[28] The stadium was intended to host the final as part of Qatar's World Cup bid,[29] and was confirmed as the final venue on 15 July 2020.[30] The stadium was allocated to also host nine previous World Cup matches, with six in the group stage and three other knockout fixtures.[31]
Lusail Stadium, owned by the Qatar Football Association, was built as part of Qatar's winning bid for the World Cup. The stadium was designed by British firm Foster and Partners and Populous,[32] supported by MANICA Architecture.[33] The stadium uses solar power to be cooled and is claimed to have a carbon zero footprint.[34] Construction began in April 2017,[35] and was planned to finish in 2020. Completion of the stadium was postponed, with construction ultimately finished in November 2021.[36] The stadium hosted its first match, the Lusail Super Cup, on 9 September 2022,[37] later than expected.[38]
Drawn in group C and coming off a three-year, 36-game-long unbeaten streak,[39] Argentina were defeated in their opening game 2–1 by Saudi Arabia.[40][41] Lionel Messi's opener from the penalty spot was followed by several disallowed Argentina goals which were ruled offside.[42] Immediately after half-time, Saudi Arabia stunned Argentina with two goals from Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari in a span of five minutes before shutting out any further attempts by the South Americans in a disciplined defensive performance.[43] However, the Argentines bounced back from the shock loss to overcome Mexico 2–0 after a long-range effort by Messi who then assisted Enzo Fernández for the second, reigniting their World Cup hopes.[44] Boosted by the win, Argentina then beat Poland with the same scoreline with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez despite a first-half penalty miss from Messi, taking first place in Group C and condemning both Mexico and Saudi Arabia to World Cup elimination.[45]
In the round of 16, the Argentines found themselves matched against group D runners-up Australia; Messi's first-ever knockout-stage goal was followed by an astute goal by Álvarez, who intercepted Australian goalkeeper Mathew Ryan to finish into an empty net as Argentina overcame Australia 2–1, despite an own goal from Fernández creating a frantic finish which required a late save from point-blank range by Emiliano Martínez.[46] Continuing a rivalry, they proceed to square off against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. In a controversial match noted for its dramatic nature, chaotic atmosphere, and fury between both teams,[47][48] it saw Argentina lead by two goals coming from Nahuel Molina and a penalty from Messi, but succumbed to two late goals by Wout Weghorst as regulation time ended 2–2 after 90 minutes; neither could find the breakthrough in extra time and penalties were used to decide the winner. Emiliano Martínez saved the first two Dutch penalties from Virgil van Dijk and Steven Berghuis, while only Fernández missed for Argentina as Lautaro Martínez scored the decisive last kick of the game, a result reminiscent of their 2014 most recent, also knockout stage meeting and sending them through the semi-finals, as they meet 2018 runners up Croatia.[49][50] In a rematch of the 2018 encounter when Croatia had won 3–0, Argentina decisively beat Croatia by the same scoreline. Lionel Messi scored a first-half penalty before Álvarez scored a solo effort five minutes later. Messi then assisted Álvarez for his double in the second half, as Argentina booked their place in the final for the second time in eight years.[51]
France started their World Cup campaign as the defending world champions, having won the most recent tournament in Russia, and was drawn in group D. Their first meeting was against AFC representative Australia. The French suffered a shock deficit after nine minutes due to a goal by Craig Goodwin, but were able to stage a comeback with a double from Olivier Giroud together with goals from Adrien Rabiot and Kylian Mbappé to win 4–1.[52] Empowered by the win, France overcame a highly organised and threatening Denmark side with Mbappé striking twice in the second half, despite conceding an equaliser from Andreas Christensen. France won 2–1 and became the first team to progress to the knockout stage of the World Cup in Qatar and the first European world champions to do so since 1994.[53] With progression assured, France rotated most of their team, resting their key players for the final game against a desperate Tunisia; France resultantly lost 1–0 courtesy of a goal by French-born Wahbi Khazri before having an equaliser by Antoine Griezmann disallowed. France maintained top of the group due to a superior goal difference over Australia.[54]
In the round of 16, France overcame group C runners-up Poland 3–1 with goals from Giroud and Mbappé, despite conceding a late penalty from Robert Lewandowski.[55] The quarter-finals saw France battling old rivals England in a tense match, with France defeating England 2–1 with goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Giroud; England found an equaliser for 1–1 courtesy of a penalty by Harry Kane but a second penalty to equalise the game was missed by Kane, granting France a place in the semi-finals.[56] France then faced the biggest underdog of the tournament, Morocco, who had beaten both Iberian representatives Spain and Portugal in the process; the French were able to end the history-making run by the African nation with two goals from Théo Hernandez and Randal Kolo Muani. France reached their second consecutive World Cup final for the first time in their history.[57]
Polish referee Szymon Marciniak was named as the referee of the final on 15 December 2022, with fellow Poles Paweł Sokolnicki and Tomasz Listkiewicz appointed as assistant referees.[58][59] Marciniak became a FIFA referee in 2011[60] and had previously served as a referee at the UEFA Euro 2016 and 2018 FIFA World Cup, as well as during the 2018 UEFA Super Cup.[59] Earlier in the tournament, Marciniak officiated the France–Denmark group stage game, as well as the Argentina–Australia match in the round of 16. It was the first time that a Polish referee led the team of officials at a World Cup final, and the second time that a Polish referee was included among the officials during such a match, after Michał Listkiewicz (father of Marciniak's assistant Tomasz) served as a linesman during the 1990 FIFA World Cup final.[59]
Ismail Elfath and Kathryn Nesbitt of the United States were appointed as fourth official and reserve assistant referee, respectively,[61] while another Pole, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, led the video assistant referee team.[58] Venezuelan Juan Soto served as assistant video assistant referee, American Kyle Atkins was the offside video assistant referee, and the role of support video assistant referee was assigned to Mexican Fernando Guerrero.[58] German Bastian Dankert and American Corey Parker served as stand-by video assistant referee and stand-by assistant video assistant referee, respectively.[62][61]
Several heads of state were in attendance, among them Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and French president Emmanuel Macron. Various members of the FIFA Council and FIFA president Gianni Infantino were also in attendance.[63] Argentine head of state Alberto Fernández did not attend after having reportedly refused to travel to Qatar due to potential political backlash.[64][65] However, Claudio Tapia, the president of the Argentine Football Association was present in the final.[66]
The tournament's closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match; it featured a collaboration between Puerto Rican singer Ozuna and French singer Gims. Also performing were Nora Fatehi, Balqees, Rahma Riad and Manal.[67]
The winners trophy was unveiled by World Cup winning captain Iker Casillas and Indian actress Deepika Padukone.[68]
Argentine singer Lali Espósito sang the ""Argentine National Anthem""[69] and Egyptian mezzo-soprano Farrah Eldibany sang the French national anthem, ""La Marseillaise"", before the match.[70]
France kicked off the match at 18:00 local time (15:00 UTC) in front of a crowd of 88,966.[71] Argentina were awarded a penalty in the 23rd minute when Ángel Di María was fouled in the penalty area by Ousmane Dembélé as Di María cut in from the left. Lionel Messi scored the penalty with a low shot to the right corner. In the 36th minute, Di Maria finished a sweeping Argentina counter-attack to make it 2–0, shooting with his left foot over the goalkeeper to the right corner of the net after a pass from Alexis Mac Allister from the right.[72] France made two early substitutions near the end of the first half and went into half-time trailing 0–2.[73]
Argentina were on course for the win, controlling possession, and defensively shutting down France, who failed to make an attempt on goal until the 80th minute, at which point France was awarded a penalty after Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Kylian Mbappé scored the penalty low to the left corner, despite Emiliano Martínez getting a hand on the ball, making the game 2–1. 97 seconds later, Kingsley Coman tackled Messi right as the game restarted, starting a rapid counter-attack which finished with Mbappé first-time volleying a lofted pass from Marcus Thuram with his right foot as he was falling to the ground to the bottom-right corner of the net to make the game 2–2; Martínez again attempted to parry the ball but couldn't keep it out. Five minutes after Mbappé's equalizer, Thuram went down in the penalty box after slightly tripping on Enzo Fernández's leg, only to be booked for diving. Both teams came close to finishing the game near the end of added time as Adrien Rabiot fired a quick shot inside the box, forcing a fumbling save from Emiliano Martínez; then three minutes later Messi had a hard shot parried over the bar by Hugo Lloris. With the score tied at the end of regulation time, the match went to extra time.[74]
After first half of extra time finished goalless, notably highlighted by two one-on-one opportunities missed by Lautaro Martínez,[74] Messi scored again for Argentina in the second period of extra time when he finished from close range after Lloris had parried a shot from Lautaro Martínez on the right, in what seemed to be the winning goal. However, France was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after a shot by Mbappé hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel.[74] Mbappé scored his third goal with his penalty kick to the left, sending Martínez the wrong way and becoming the second player to score a hat-trick in a men's World Cup final after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[73] In the 123rd minute, with 15 seconds of the extra time to spare, a loose ball fell to an unmarked Kolo Muani at the edge of the box, who shot low to the right of the goal; however, Emiliano Martínez blocked the shot with his left shin. Argentina counter-attacked immediately, ending with Lautaro Martínez heading wide of the goal from 10 yards.[73] France produced one last attack when Mbappé dribbled in the penalty box, passing three Argentina defenders, only for Paulo Dybala to make a timely clearance off the field.[75] The referee then blew the final whistle of extra time and the match went to a penalty shoot-out.
For third time in history, the World Cup final would be decided on penalties. Mbappé and Messi successfully converted the first two attempts to begin the penalty shootout at 1–1. Argentina goalkeeper Martínez would continue to use the psychological tactics and means of gamesmanship that he utilized during the penalty shoot-outs in the quarter-final against the Netherlands. After delaying Kingsley Coman's attempt by arguing with the referee, Martínez then saved Coman's shot, which was down low to Martínez's right.[76] Dybala sent a shot into the net up the middle to give Argentina a 2–1 lead. Before Aurélien Tchouaméni's shot, Martínez picked up the ball and then threw it to the edge of the box. Tchouaméni then sent his shot wide of the goal to the left.[76] Leandro Paredes then scored to put France on the brink of defeat at 3–1. Kolo Muani kept France alive by scoring his chance and reducing France's deficit to 3–2; Martínez attempted to use his psychological tactics on Kolo Muani but was instead shown a yellow card.[77] Montiel was then given a chance to make up for his late handball by clinching the championship for Argentina. Montiel scored low to the left, securing the 4–2 penalty shoot-out victory for Argentina and giving them their third World Cup trophy and first since 1986.[78]
Pundits, commentators, and audiences praised the intensity, stressful atmosphere, and thrilling back-and-forth nature of the match, highlighting the number of goals scored, and with many media outlets spotlighting it as a duel between Paris Saint-Germain teammates Messi and Mbappé.[85][86][87][88] The match has since been hailed as one of the most exciting World Cup finals, and among the greatest football matches ever.[89][90][91][92]
With the victory, Argentina won their third FIFA World Cup title to surpass France and Uruguay, their titles ranking behind only Brazil's five and the four of Italy and Germany. They became the first South American and first non-European side to win the World Cup since Brazil in 2002, and the first reigning champions of the Copa América to win the World Cup.[94] Having won on penalties against the Netherlands in the quarter-finals, Argentina became the first team to have won on that method twice en route to the title.[95] It was the tenth World Cup title for a South American side, and the eighth South American victory in eleven finals facing European opposition. France became the third defending champions to lose in the following final, after Argentina in 1990 and Brazil in 1998.[96] The match was the third FIFA World Cup final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out, after 1994 and 2006, the latter of which France lost to Italy.[97] This meant that France had not won on penalties in all competitions since the 1998 World Cup quarter-final against Italy. The six goals in the final brought the total number of goals in the tournament to a record 172, surpassing the 171 goals scored in 1998 and 2014.[98]
FIFA president Gianni Infantino was present on the pitch stage during the awards ceremony to hand out the medals and present the trophy to the Argentine captain Lionel Messi. He was joined by Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, French president Emmanuel Macron, Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia, French Football Federation president Noël Le Graët, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and UEFA president Aleksander Čeferin.[99] Sergio Batista and Nery Pumpido, World Cup winners with Argentina in 1986, brought the trophy onto the pitch for the ceremony.[100] Before being presented with the trophy by the Emir and Infantino, Messi was given a bisht to wear by the Emir prior to the trophy celebration. The trophy presentation had scenery unlike previous tournaments, with confetti replaced by pyrotechnics and lights with a backdrop of some orchestral cinematic music.[101]
Messi was named as the player of the match[81] and won his second Golden Ball award after 2014 as the best player of the tournament, becoming the first (and so far only) player to receive the award twice.[102] He also won the Silver Boot award with the second-most goals at the tournament, seven.[103] Messi's appearance in the final, his 26th World Cup game, meant he surpassed Lothar Matthäus as the player with the most appearances in the World Cup.[104] With his goals, Messi became the second player to score in the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals and final of a World Cup tournament, after Hungary's György Sárosi in 1938, and the only player to score in all of those knockout rounds as well as the group stage.[105] Having scored once in the previous final, Mbappé's hat-trick made him the highest-scoring player in the final of the World Cup with four goals, surpassing the three of Hurst, Pelé, Vavá and Zinedine Zidane.[106] In addition, with his three goals, he surpassed Messi to win the Golden Boot award as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals,[103] the most in a World Cup since Brazil's Ronaldo in 2002, and also was awarded the Silver Ball as the second-best player of the World Cup.[107] Argentina's Emiliano Martínez won the Golden Glove award as the best goalkeeper of the tournament, while his teammate Enzo Fernández won the Young Player Award as the best player at the World Cup who is at most 21 (born on or after 1 January 2001).[102]
In Argentina, celebrations erupted across the country, most notably in the capital Buenos Aires and in Rosario, Messi's hometown.[108] On 20 December, the celebration in the streets of Buenos Aires after the arrival of the players of Argentina gathered a crowd estimated by local media at over four million people, forcing the team to be airlifted by helicopter out of their bus.[109] On 22 December, the French Football Federation confirmed to have lodged a formal complaint against the Argentine goalkeeper Emiliano Martínez for unsporting behaviour which included incidents such as a sarcastic prayer for silence for French forward Kylian Mbappé in the Argentine locker room after the match, as well as being seen holding and laughing at a toy with a facial cut of Mbappé's face stuck to it during the Argentine victory parade.[110][111] In France, riots erupted across the country in cities including Paris, Lyon and Nice;[112] these were very similar to those after their victory in 2018, as well as after victories against England and Morocco earlier in the tournament. Some French players like Kingsley Coman, Randal Kolo Muani and Aurélien Tchouaméni were racially abused online due to their performances by their own fans.[113] Within 48 hours of Messi posting, the Instagram post with the World Cup trophy had surpassed 75 million likes, and in doing so, it became the most-liked social media post ever across all social media platforms surpassing the previous most-liked Instagram post, the world record egg.[114][115]",2291.0,16.02097902097902,0.09023698215364888,0.39627327610660956,13.92,581.0,4.062937062937063,42.65,14.4,14.8,11.2,16.6,8.35,13.0,54.15,14.0,305.82,1.9140113487560018,6.116979484941074,0.4185945002182453

International football competition
The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010.[2] It was the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East and Persian Gulf countries, and the second in an Asian country after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]
This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 World Cup. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot and humid climate in summers,[3] the event was held in November and December, becoming the first one to take place outside the traditional months of May, June, and July.[3][4] It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.
Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Mbappé also became the first player to score in two consecutive finals since Vavá of Brazil did the same in 1958 and 1962.
Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's best player, winning his second Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, with the win fulfilling for some commentators a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as the greatest player of all time.[5] Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.
The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar attracted significant criticism, with concerns raised over the country's treatment of migrant workers, women, and members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[B]
Format
The FIFA World Cup is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by FIFA.[14][15] The tournament, held every four years, was first played in 1930 in Uruguay,[16] and has been contested by 32 teams since the 1998 event.[16] The tournament was contested with eight round-robin groups followed by a knockout round for 16 teams.[17] The defending champions were France, who defeated Croatia 4–2 in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final.[18][19] The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[20] from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[21][22][23] Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the Arab world.[24] Spectators were not required to follow most COVID-19 restrictions such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[25]
Schedule
Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity,[3][22][26] the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[6][27] As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[28]
The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA on 15 July 2020.[29] The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[30][31][32] The final was played on 18 December 2022, National Day, at Lusail Stadium.[29][33] Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture were set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time was only made after the final draw, with the teams of each specific fixture known. This was due to the close proximity of the venues, which allowed the organizers to optimize stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audiences.[29]
The matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[33]
FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[34][35]
Prize money
In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous tournament.[36]
Rule changes
The tournament featured new substitution rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in extra time.[37][38][39] In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature concussion substitutions, whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[40] Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand suffered a concussion in his country's opening match against England and was replaced by Hossein Hosseini. This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[41]
Host selection
The bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[42] Initially, 11 bids were made for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[43][44] and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of Indonesian government guarantee to support the bid.[45]
After UEFA were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[46] There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States.
The 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich, Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[47] Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[48] The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having ""high operational risk"",[49] generated criticism from media commentators.[50] It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals,[51] which led to the 2015 FIFA corruption case.
The voting patterns were as follows:[52]
Cost of hosting the tournament
At an estimated cost of over $220 billion,[53] it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8 billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.[54]
Venues
The first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability.[55] The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 °C (36 °F).[56][57]
Their marketing included statements describing the stadiums as zero waste, and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[56][57] Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer & Partners.[58] The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.[59]
In an April 2013 report by Merrill Lynch, the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.[60] Bloomberg said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.[61] By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near Doha, with the exception of Al Khor.[62][63]
Eight stadiums in five Qatarian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Qatar were announced as hosts) and 2022, seven of the eight stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the Khalifa International Stadium was renovated for the tournament.
Of these eight stadiums, all but two have since been either dismantled, or have been moderately or heavily modified. The Stadium 974 was supposed to be dismantled after the tournament; as of November 2024 however, this has not happened and the stadium has sat abandoned in its original site—this stadium was the first planned temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup.[64] Lusail Stadium, Al Bayt Stadium, Ahmad bin Ali Stadium, Education City Stadium, Al Thumama Stadium and Al Janoub Stadium will be moderately or heavily modified as reduce their capacity by half.[65] The Khalifa International Stadium (latter along with the Stadium 974) are the only largely unmodified stadium that were used for this tournament.

Team base camps
Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team.[82][83] This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition in 1930, with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the Doha Area. It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[84][85]
Security
The Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.[86] The Turkish government provided about 3,000 riot police personnel,[86] and Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.[87]
Teams
Qualification
FIFA's six continental confederations organised their own qualifying competitions. All 211 FIFA member associations were eligible to enter qualification. The Qatari national team, as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. However, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) obliged Qatar to participate in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also act as qualification for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup.[88] Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, Lebanon, the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[89] France, the reigning World Cup champions, qualified for the event through European qualification.[90]
Saint Lucia initially entered CONCACAF qualification but withdrew from it before their first match. North Korea withdrew from the AFC qualifying round due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both American Samoa and Samoa withdrew before the OFC qualification draw due to travel restrictions following the pandemic.[91] Tonga withdrew after the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami.[92] Due to COVID-19 outbreaks in their squads, Vanuatu and Cook Islands also withdrew because of the travel restrictions.[93][94]
Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018.[95] Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since Italy in 1934. The Netherlands, Ecuador, Ghana, Cameroon, and the United States returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 tournament. Canada returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in 1986.[96] Wales made their first appearance in 64 years—the longest-ever gap for any team, their only previous participation having been in 1958.[97]
Italy, four-time winners and reigning European champions, failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the qualification play-off semi-finals.[98] The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the FIFA Men's World Rankings that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous UEFA European Championship, following Czechoslovakia in 1978, Denmark in 1994, and Greece in 2006.[99] The previous World Cup hosts, Russia, were disqualified from competing due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[100]
Chile, the 2015 and 2016 Copa América winners, failed to qualify for the second consecutive time. Nigeria were defeated by Ghana on away goals in Confederation of African Football (CAF) final playoff round, having qualified for the previous three World Cups and six out of the last seven. Egypt, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Iceland, and Sweden, all of whom qualified for the 2018 World Cup, did not qualify for the 2022 tournament.[101] Ghana were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.[102]
The qualified teams, listed by region, with numbers in parentheses indicating final positions in the FIFA Men's World Ranking before the tournament were:[103]
Squads
Before submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[104] Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[105] In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the 2018 World Cup.[106] All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for France and Iran, who chose 25 players.[107][108]
Draw
The final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in Doha, Qatar,[109] on 1 April 2022,[110] 19:00 AST, prior to the completion of qualification. The two winners of the inter-confederation play-offs and the winner of the Path A of the UEFA play-offs were not known at the time of the draw.[111] The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by Carli Lloyd, Jermaine Jenas and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of Cafu (Brazil), Lothar Matthäus (Germany), Adel Ahmed Malalla (Qatar), Ali Daei (Iran), Bora Milutinović (Serbia/Mexico), Jay-Jay Okocha (Nigeria), Rabah Madjer (Algeria), and Tim Cahill (Australia).[112][113]
For the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the FIFA Men's World Rankings of 31 March 2022.[114] Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.[115]
This principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the match schedule), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.[115] The pots for the draw are shown below.[116]
Draw result
The eight groups were formed randomly, selecting one team from each of the four pots. Two teams from the same confederation could not be placed into the same group, with the exception of UEFA teams, where up to two teams could be in the same group. The only team whose position in the draw was predetermined was the host Qatar, who were placed into position A1.
Officiating
In May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 video assistant referees for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.[118][119]
For the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament.[120] France's Stéphanie Frappart, Salima Mukansanga from Rwanda, and Yoshimi Yamashita from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup.[121] Frappart previously oversaw the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final.[122] They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the Costa Rica vs Germany match in Group E on 1 December.[123]
Gambian referee Bakary Gassama and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the 2018 final.[124][125][126] Other returning officials included referees César Arturo Ramos of Mexico and Janny Sikazwe of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee Mohammadreza Mansouri.[127][128][129]
On 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that Polish referee Szymon Marciniak would adjudicate the final.[130]
Opening ceremony
The opening ceremony took place on Sunday, 20 November 2022 at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor, prior to the opening match of the tournament between hosts Qatar and Ecuador.[131] It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, along with performances by South Korean singer and BTS member Jungkook and Qatari singer Fahad Al Kubaisi.[132][133] It was the first time that the Qur'an had been recited as part of the opening ceremony.[134] During the ceremony, Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani declared the tournament open.[135]
Group stage
The group stage was played from 20 November to 2 December.[136] Competing countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, where the top two teams advanced to the knockout stage.
Group A
The first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes,[138] but eventually won 2–0 with two goals from Enner Valencia.[139] Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.[140][141][142] Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with ESPN reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left.[143][144] The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2–0 over Senegal. Cody Gakpo scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and Davy Klaassen added a second in stoppage time.[145] Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; Boulaye Dia capitalised on a slip by Boualem Khoukhi to put Senegal 1–0 ahead. Famara Diédhiou scored a second with a header, before Mohammed Muntari scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3–1 after an 84th-minute goal by Bamba Dieng. With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.[146] Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.[147] The Netherlands won 2–0 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and Frenkie de Jong to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches.[148] Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, Ismaïla Sarr scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, Moisés Caicedo scored an equaliser, but shortly after, Kalidou Koulibaly gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.[149]
Group B
England completed a 6–2 victory over Iran. Iranian keeper Alireza Beiranvand was removed from the game for a suspected concussion before England scored three first-half goals.[150] Mehdi Taremi scored in the second half after which England defender Harry Maguire was also removed for a concussion.[150] Timothy Weah, of the United States, scored a first-half goal against Wales; however, the match finished as a draw after a penalty kick was won and scored by Gareth Bale.[151] Iran defeated Wales 2–0 following a red card to Welsh goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey after he committed a foul outside of his penalty area. Substitute Rouzbeh Cheshmi scored the first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by Ramin Rezaeian scoring three minutes later.[152] England and the United States played to a 0–0 draw, with only four shots on target between them, and one shot from Christian Pulisic hit the crossbar.[153] England won the group following a 3–0 win over Wales with a goal by Phil Foden and two by Marcus Rashford.[154] Christian Pulisic scored the winning goal as the United States defeated Iran 1–0 to qualify for the round of 16.[155]
Group C
Argentina took an early lead against Saudi Arabia after Lionel Messi scored a penalty kick after ten minutes; however, second-half goals by Saleh Al-Shehri and Salem Al-Dawsari won the match 2–1 for Saudi Arabia,[156] a result the media considered one of the biggest upsets in the history of the event.[157][158] The match between Mexico and Poland ended as a goalless 0–0 draw after Guillermo Ochoa saved Robert Lewandowski's penalty kick attempt.[159] Lewandowski scored his first career World Cup goal in a 2–0 win over Saudi Arabia four days later.[160][161] Argentina defeated Mexico 2–0, with Messi scoring the opener and later assisting teammate Enzo Fernández who scored his first international goal.[162][163] Argentina won their last game against Poland with goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Julián Álvarez, which was enough to win the group;[164] Poland qualified for the knockout stage on goal difference, thanks to Saudi Arabia scoring an injury-time consolation goal against Mexico in a match already lost.[165]
Group D
The match between Denmark and Tunisia ended as a goalless draw; both teams had goals disallowed by offside calls.[166] Danish midfielder Christian Eriksen made his first major international appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest at the UEFA Euro 2020.[166] Defending champions France went a goal behind to Australia, after a Craig Goodwin goal within ten minutes. France, however, scored four goals, by Adrien Rabiot, Kylian Mbappé and two by Olivier Giroud to win 4–1.[167] The goals tied Giroud with Thierry Henry as France's all-time top goalscorer.[167] Mitchell Duke scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010.[168][169] Mbappé scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2–1. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round—the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round.[168][170] Mathew Leckie scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1–0, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win.[171] Wahbi Khazri scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although Antoine Griezmann equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.[172]
Group E
Group E began with Japan facing 2014 champions Germany. After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's İlkay Gündoğan, Japan scored two second-half goals by Ritsu Dōan and Takuma Asano in a 2–1 win.[173] In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7–0. First-half goals by Dani Olmo, Marco Asensio, and Ferran Torres were followed by goals by Gavi, Carlos Soler, Alvaro Morata, and a second by Torres.[174][175] This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the 2010 event by the same scoreline.[176] Costa Rica defeated Japan 1–0, with Keysher Fuller scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament.[177] Germany and Spain drew 1–1, with Álvaro Morata scoring for Spain and Niclas Füllkrug scoring for Germany.[178][179][180] Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match.[181] Japan equalised on Ritsu Doan before a second goal by Ao Tanaka was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play.[182] The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2–1 win. Disputes over the VAR's call was only settled when the Associated Press released an iconic bird's eye photo of the ball after the match.[182] Serge Gnabry scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by Yeltsin Tejeda and Juan Vargas gave Costa Rica a 2–1 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals—two by Kai Havertz and a goal by Niclas Fullkrug, ending in a 4–2 win for Germany—which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages.[183] Japan won the group ahead of Spain.[184]
Group F
Group F's first match was a goalless draw between Morocco and Croatia.[185] Canada had a penalty kick in the first half of their match against Belgium which was saved by Thibaut Courtois. Belgium won the match by a single goal by Michy Batshuayi.[186][187] Belgium lost 2–0 to Morocco, despite Morocco having a long-range direct free kick goal by Hakim Ziyech overturned for an offside on another player in the lead up to the goal. Two second-half goals from Zakaria Aboukhlal and Romain Saïss helped the Morocco win their first World Cup match since 1998.[188][189] The match sparked riots in Belgium, with fires and fireworks being set off by residents.[190] Alphonso Davies scored Canada's first World Cup goal to give Canada the lead over Croatia. Goals by Marko Livaja, Lovro Majer, and two by Andrej Kramarić for Croatia completed a 4–1 victory.[191] Morocco scored two early goals through Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri in their game against Canada and qualified following a 2–1 victory. Canada's only goal was an own goal by Nayef Aguerd.[192] Croatia and Belgium played a goalless draw which eliminated Belgium, whose team was ranked second in the world, from the tournament.[193]
Group G
Breel Embolo scored the only goal in Switzerland's 1–0 defeat of Cameroon.[194] Richarlison scored two goals as Brazil won against Serbia, with star player Neymar receiving an ankle injury.[195] Cameroon's Jean-Charles Castelletto scored the opening goal against Serbia, but they were quickly behind as Serbia scored three goals by Strahinja Pavlović, Sergej Milinković-Savić, and Aleksandar Mitrović either side of half time. Cameroon, however, scored goals through Vincent Aboubakar and Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting, completing a 3–3 draw.[196] An 83rd-minute winner by Casemiro for Brazil over Switzerland was enough for them to qualify for the knockout stage.[197] Having already qualified, Brazil were unable to win their final group game, as they were defeated by Cameroon 1–0 following a goal by Vincent Aboubakar. Already having a yellow card, he was later sent off for removing his shirt in celebrating the goal.[198] Cameroon, however, did not qualify, as Switzerland defeated Serbia 3–2.[199]
Group H
Uruguay and South Korea played to a goalless draw.[200] A goalless first half between Portugal and Ghana preceded a penalty converted by Cristiano Ronaldo to give Portugal the lead. In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by André Ayew before goals by João Félix, and Rafael Leão by Portugal put them 3–1 ahead. Osman Bukari scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while Iñaki Williams had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3–2 to Portugal.[201] Ghanaian Mohammed Salisu opened the scoring against South Korea, with Mohammed Kudus following it up. In the second half, Cho Gue-sung scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3–2 for Ghana.[202] Portugal defeated Uruguay 2–0 with two goals from Bruno Fernandes, advancing them to the knockout stage.[203] A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from José María Giménez.[204][205] Portugal led South Korea through Ricardo Horta after 10 minutes. However, goals by Kim Young-gwon and Hwang Hee-chan won the match 2–1 for South Korea.[206] Giorgian de Arrascaeta scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2–0.[207] However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored.[208] Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.[209][210][211]
Knockout stage
In the knockout stage, if the scores were equal when normal playing time expired, extra time was played for two periods of 15 minutes each. This was followed, if required, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.[137]
Bracket
Round of 16
The round of 16 was played from 3 to 7 December,[33] which for the first time ever included teams from the Americas and four other continents.[212] Group A winners Netherlands scored goals through Memphis Depay, Daley Blind, and Denzel Dumfries as they defeated the United States 3–1, with Haji Wright scoring for the United States.[213] Messi scored his third of the tournament alongside Julián Álvarez to give Argentina a two-goal lead over Australia, and despite an Enzo Fernández own goal from a Craig Goodwin shot, Argentina won 2–1.[214] Olivier Giroud's goal and Mbappé's brace enabled France to have a 3–1 victory over Poland, with Robert Lewandowski scoring the lone goal for Poland from a penalty.[215] England beat Senegal 3–0, with goals coming from Jordan Henderson, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka.[216] Daizen Maeda scored for Japan against Croatia in the first half before a leveller from Ivan Perišić in the second. Neither team could find the winner, with Croatia defeating Japan 3–1 in a penalty shoot-out.[217] Vinícius Júnior, Neymar, Richarlison, and Lucas Paquetá all scored for Brazil, but a volley from South Korean Paik Seung-ho reduced the deficit to 4–1.[218] Pablo Sarabia had the best chance for Spain to break the deadlock against Morocco in stoppage time after two goalless hours, but he hit the goalie's right-hand post after a shot from the left; Morocco won the match 3–0 on penalties.[219] A hat-trick by Gonçalo Ramos led Portugal to defeat Switzerland 6–1, with goals from Portugal's Pepe, Raphaël Guerreiro, and Rafael Leão and from Switzerland's Manuel Akanji.[220]
Quarter-finals
The quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December.[33] Croatia and Brazil ended 0–0 after 90 minutes and went to extra time. Neymar scored for Brazil in the 15th minute of extra time. Croatia, however, equalised through Bruno Petković in the second period of extra time. With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4–2.[221][222] In the second quarter-final match, Nahuel Molina and Messi scored for Argentina before Wout Weghorst equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4–3.[223] Morocco defeated Portugal 1–0, with Youssef En-Nesyri scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition.[224] Despite Harry Kane scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2–1 by virtue of goals from Aurélien Tchouaméni and Olivier Giroud and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[225][226]
Semi-finals
The semi-finals were played on 13 and 14 December.[33] Messi scored a penalty kick before Julián Álvarez scored twice to give Argentina a 3–0 victory over Croatia.[227] Théo Hernandez scored after five minutes as France led Morocco for most of the game. Randal Kolo Muani scored in the 78th minute to complete a 2–0 victory for France over Morocco as they reached their second consecutive final.[228]
Third place play-off
The third place play-off was played on 17 December. The two teams had played against each other in their opening game in Group F which finished 0–0. Joško Gvardiol promptly scored for Croatia, with Achraf Dari equalising just 2 minutes later. Mislav Oršić scored the winner for Croatia as the match finished 2–1.[229] Morocco earned 4th place, a record for the team and the best World Cup finish of any African or Arab nation.[230]
Final
The final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams had won the event twice previously.[231] Early goals from Lionel Messi and Ángel Di María gave Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[231][232] Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by Nicolás Otamendi. Mbappé scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[232] With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a hat-trick in the final of a World Cup after Geoff Hurst for England in 1966.[232] With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2.[232] This marked their third World Cup win and their first since 1986.[232]

Additionally, FIFA.com shortlisted 10 goals for users to vote on as the tournament's best. The award was won by Brazil's Richarlison for his second goal in the group stage match against Serbia.[241]
Marketing
Branding
The official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands[242] and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the Doha Tower, Katara Cultural Village amphitheatre, Msheireb Downtown Doha, and Zubarah. It is based on a shawl (reflecting upon the tournament's late-Autumn scheduling) and desert dunes, and was shaped to resemble the tournament trophy, the infinity symbol, and the number ""8""—reflecting upon the ""interconnected"" event and the eight host stadiums. The typography of the emblem's wordmark incorporated kashida—the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in Arabic script to provide typographical emphasis.[243][244][245]
H.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to WIPO Magazine that the tournament provided an opportunity to ""promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment"", and highlighted that the country has used sports to demonstrate its ""commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations.""[246]
Merchandise
Electronic Arts' licensed video games FIFA Mobile and FIFA 23 (except on Nintendo Switch) received free updates with tie-in content for the 2022 World Cup on 8 and 9 November 2022, respectively. The update for FIFA 23 added World Cup-themed tournament modes with all teams and two of the stadiums from the event, campaigns and World Cup-themed unlockable content for Ultimate Team mode, and real-time squad and fixture updates during the tournament.[247]
On 24 August 2022, the Panini Group produced themed stickers and a sticker album for a 14th consecutive World Cup. This year, rare cards with coloured borders were included and could be collected, traded, or sold.[248]
On 12 April 2022, FIFA released an over-the-top media service and app revolving around the World Cup called FIFA+, where fans could play games, predict matches, and compete with others.[249]
Broadcasting rights
In May 2022, Infantino projected that the 2022 FIFA World Cup could be the most-watched in its history, with a global audience of at least 5 billion. The 2018 tournament was seen by 3.57 billion across the tournament.[250] The various controversies surrounding the World Cup in Qatar led to questions over how the tournament would be covered in the media, and whether they would be discussed or addressed during coverage.[251][252] The match between England and the United States in the group stage was seen by approximately 20 million viewers across both Fox and Telemundo, ranking among the highest-rated associated football broadcasts in the United States (behind a 2014 World Cup match that drew 24.7 million).[253][254]
Symbols
Mascot
The tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is ""Laʼeeb"" (Arabic: لعيب, romanized: Laʿīb), which is an Arabic word meaning ""super-skilled player"". The official website of FIFA says: ""Laʼeeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes"", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, ""a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone"".[286]
Match ball
The official match ball, ""Adidas Al Rihla"", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word Al-Rihla (الْرِّحْلَة ar-riḥla) means ""the journey"". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As ""the game is getting faster"" and ""speeds up"", the ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second[287] and it has to be charged before each game.[288] Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World Cup.[289]
The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the ""Adidas Al Hilm"" (Arabic: الحلم, romanized: al-ḥulm, lit. ''the dream'', a reference to ""every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup"").[290] While the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design,[291] a reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[292]
Music
For the first time, a multi-song FIFA World Cup official soundtrack has been released, instead of one official song.[293] The first song of the album is ""Hayya Hayya (Better Together)"", performed by Trinidad Cardona, Davido, and AISHA, released on 1 April 2022 along with the music video.[294] The second song is ""Arhbo"", performed by Gims and Ozuna, released on 19 August 2022 along with the music video.[295] The third song is ""The World Is Yours to Take"" performed by American rapper Lil Baby, released on 23 September 2022 along with a music video.[296] The fourth song is ""Light The Sky"" performed by Nora Fatehi, Manal, Rahma Riad, and Balqees, composed by RedOne and released on 7 October 2022 along with the music video.[297]
A fifth song, ""Tukoh Taka"", performed by Nicki Minaj, Maluma and Myriam Fares, was released on 17 November 2022 along with the music video, serving as the official song of the FIFA Fan Festival.[298] The final song is ""Dreamers"" by Jungkook of BTS released on 20 November 2022. It was performed with Fahad Al-Kubaisi during the tournament's opening ceremony.[299][300]
Controversies
Criticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's human-rights record,[301] namely their treatment of migrant workers,[301] women, and position on LGBT rights,[302] leading to allegations of sportswashing.[F] Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and wider FIFA corruption.[7][306] Boycotts of the event were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[304][305] with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a ""mistake"".[307][308] The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[309] In June 2023, Le Point revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite ""calls for a boycott"". According to the study by Arcom, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.[310]
Host selection criticism
There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members.[311] These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see § Bidding corruption allegations, 2014, below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator Michael J. Garcia described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing ""numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations.""[312]
In May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering related to the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids.[313][314] In August 2018, former FIFA president Sepp Blatter claimed that Qatar had used ""black ops"", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.[315] Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former CIA officer turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.[316]
In September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.[317]
In September 2023 it was reported that court documents show a transfer of $300M dollars were sent top people who voted on the 2022 World Cup host.[318]
Qatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with Amnesty International referring to ""forced labour"" and poor working conditions,[319][320] while many migrant workers reported having to pay large ""recruitment fees"" to obtain employment.[321] The Guardian newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. The Guardian estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the Qatari government adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the kafala system. Furthermore, in November 2017, the International Labour Organization concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights.[322] According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.[323]
Qatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup – the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the 1954 World Cup, which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the 2002 World Cup in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the 1998 edition. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the Doha metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup since 1930 in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[324]
Due to Qatar's laws on alcohol consumption, World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated ""sobering-up"" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[325] Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety.[326] If a fan was sent to the ""sobering up"" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour.[327] Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a ""cultural clash"" between social conservatism and Islamic morality against the ""norms"" of secular Western liberal democracies.[12][328]
A number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[329][330] Issues regarding from human rights,[9][302] worker conditions, the rights of LGBT fans,[302] and the illegality of homosexuality in Qatar.[331][332][333] In December 2020, Qatar said rainbow flags would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[334] Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of pride flags at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's modesty and avoid public displays of affection.[335][336] Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit alcohol consumption during the event,[337][338] even though drinking in public was not permitted.[339] There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages.[340] Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only.[341] However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.[340][342][343][344][345]
The climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December.[6] In May 2014, Sepp Blatter, who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a ""mistake"" because of the extreme heat.[6][346][347] While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were ""very much linked to racism and discrimination"".[348] The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.[349]
Prior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's TV 2 was threatened by security during a live report from the Katara Cultural Village; the organising committee apologised, stating that they were ""mistakenly interrupted"".[350] Tony O'Donoghue of Ireland's RTÉ also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.[351]
Phaedra Almajid, a former media officer for Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, has alleged that three African football officials were offered bribes to support Qatar's bid. In a Netflix documentary series ""FIFA Uncovered,"" Almajid claims that Hassan Al Thawadi, who led Qatar's bid, offered €2.3 million each to Issa Hayatou of Cameroon, Jacques Anouma of Ivory Coast, and Amos Adamu of Nigeria in exchange for their votes. Qatar was competing with Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US for their bid for the 2022 World Cup. The alleged offer was made during a meeting of African football federations in January 2010. Almajid states that the money was intended for the football federations, not as personal bribes. She initially disclosed these allegations anonymously to the Sunday Times after being dismissed from her position, but later retracted her claims, citing threats from Qatar. Al Thawadi has denied these allegations, calling them false and expressing disappointment at the situation. The controversy adds to the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.[352]
Targeted hacking campaigns against critics
On November 2, 2022, Swiss media outlet SRF Investigativ published an investigative piece about Qatar's elaborate and extensive espionage operation to secure the World Cup hosting rights. The operation, which was dubbed Project Merciless, involved hacking emails and phones of FIFA officials and critics of Qatar's corruption and poor human rights record. It also targeted their friends and family members to run smear campaigns and influence FIFA policy. Starting on January 5, 2012, a cyberattack targeted Peter Hargitay, a Zurich-based FIFA insider and consultant for Australia's 2022 World Cup bid. Hargitay and his son hired an expert who traced the hack to a server linked to Rajat Khare of the mercenary Indian hack-for-hire firm Appin.[353][354][355][356] In November 2022, a lower court in Geneva ordered the publication to provisionally remove Rajat Khare's name and photo from the article.[357] As a result, he is currently referred to as an entrepreneur, though his name still appears in a Reuters article about his involvement in the hacking.[358]
On 5 November 2022, The Sunday Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.[359]
Migrant workers
There was criticism regarding the state of human rights in Qatar and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.[363] On 23 October 2022, an article published by The Guardian included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable.[364] Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the Kafala system.[365]
According to Sharan Burrow, general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, ""the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system.""[366]
FIFA President Gianni Infantino has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament.[367] Others have asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than Russia and China, which were subjected to less harsh criticism for the same problems when hosting important athletic events in the years before the tournament.[368]
Move to November and December
Owing to the climate in Qatar, concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[6] In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.[369] On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[370] to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the 2022 Winter Olympics in February, the 2022 Winter Paralympics in March and Ramadan in April.[371][372]
The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, while there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[373] FIFA executive committee member Theo Zwanziger said that awarding the event to Qatar was a ""blatant mistake"".[374]
Frank Lowy, chairman of Football Federation Australia, said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the A-League, they would seek compensation from FIFA.[375] Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[376] In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December.[377] Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.[378]
Bidding corruption allegations, 2014
Some allegations were made over the role of former football official Mohammed bin Hammam played in securing the bid.[379] A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5 million by Qatar.[380] She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials.[381][382] In March 2014, it was discovered that former CONCACAF president Jack Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.[383]
The Sunday Times published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.[384] Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, Sony, Adidas, Visa, Hyundai, and Coca-Cola, called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.[385][386] Jim Boyce, vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.[387][388] FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fueled by racism in the British media.[389][390]
In the 2015 FIFA corruption case, Swiss officials, operating under information from the United States Department of Justice, arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million corruption and bribery scandal.[391] From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[392] In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[393]
Following the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup.[394] In an interview published on the same day, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that ""should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled.""[395][396]
In 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[397] At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar ""pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways"" but did not ""compromise the integrity"" of the overall bid process.[398] Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is ""materially incomplete"" and contains ""erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions"".[398]
In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it ""does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought"" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.[399]
Russian participation
On 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.[400] The Russian national team were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the Russian flag and anthem, could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active.[401] The decision was appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,[402] and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organized or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.[403]
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's qualifying path—Czech Republic, Poland, and Sweden—announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.[404] Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.[405][406][407]
On 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches behind closed doors in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,[408] the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the Russian Football Union (""RFU""), rather than ""Russia"".[409] The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions ""until further notice"", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[410]
LGBT and women's rights
There are no LGBT rights in Qatar, with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBTQ+ rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans,[411] as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.[412] The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands.[413] Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.[414][415]
Security officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows.[416][417] American journalist Grant Wahl was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.[418] Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium.[419][420] Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticized the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing defibrillators in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl.[421] In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene.[422] An autopsy done on Wahl in New York City later revealed that Wahl died from an aortic aneurysm rupture.[423]
Discrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized.[424][425] Women in Qatar have few freedoms,[424][426] as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.[427]
Qatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having sex outside of marriage. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of flagellation and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.[428]
Influence of Iran
In November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of Iran were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[429] in light of the Mahsa Amini protests. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.[430]
In November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, Iran International, known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.[431] On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.[432] These included t-shirts and signs with ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of Mahsa Amini.[433] This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup.[429] In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with ""Woman, Life, Freedom"" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.[434]
Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors
Qatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked kosher food and public Jewish prayer services at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.[435][436] Qatar alleged that they could not ""secure"" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 religious Jews from Israel and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.[437]
Whilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,[437] the Israeli government said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi Mendy Chitrik was open in time for the first match. Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.[438]
Multiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from Arab nations waving Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans while harassing them.[302][439][440] Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed.[441] The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.[442]
Accommodation
The Rawdat Al Jahhaniya fan village was criticised for its overpriced ""night cabins"" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.[443] The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.[444][445] The tent village in Al Khor was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.[446][447] The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.[448]
Security
The Qatari government employed about 50,000 security personnel including police departments and military forces from at least thirteen countries, including Poland, Germany, France, Kuwait, Jordan, Italy, Palestine, Spain, Pakistan, Turkey, USA, Saudi Arabia and the United Kingdom.[449][450]
Turkey
Turkey provided about 3000 riot police personnel.[449]
Pakistan
Pakistan provided about 4,500 Army troops to Qatar for the event.[451]

64,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/may/06/gm-mosquitoes-inside-the-lab-breeding-six-legged-agents-in-the-war-on-malaria,"In an unassuming building on an industrial estate outside Oxford, Michal Bilski sits in a windowless room with electric fly swatters and sticky tape on the wall, peering down a microscope. On the slide before him is a line of mosquito eggs that he collected less than an hour previously and put into position with a brush.
Bilski manoeuvres a small needle filled with a DNA concoction and uses it to pierce each egg and inject a tiny amount.
“Each slide has between 50 and 100 eggs on it, and it takes from 15 minutes to half an hour to inject them all,” he says. “Normally in a day we would inject between 500 to over 1,000 eggs.”
Bilski, a research and development team leader for the biotechnology company Oxitec, is carrying out one of the early stages in the process of making genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes.
It is hoped the insects that hatch will prove instrumental in the fight against diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, Zika and chikungunya of which mosquitoes are vectors.
Last year, Oxitec released tens of thousands of GM mosquitoes in Djibouti, where there has been a resurgence of malaria caused by an invasive species. It was the first time such mosquitoes have been released in east Africa and the second time on the continent.
It follows multiple releases of modified mosquitoes in Florida and Brazil to combat dengue fever, a neglected tropical disease.
The impact of these mosquitoes on malaria transmission could be significant, believes Lottie Renwick, head of strategy for Malaria No More UK. “They will play a really major role and be gamechanging,” she says, but adds that the intervention needs to work alongside other tools such as mosquito nets and injections.
Malaria is transmitted by female mosquitoes and is one of the biggest killers of children under five. According to the World Health Organization, in 2023 there were an estimated 263m cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 83 countries.
Africa bears the greatest burden (94% of cases) and children under five accounted for more than three-quarters (76%) of all malaria deaths.
Djibouti, an east African country of a million people, had been close to eliminating the disease, but cases jumped from just 27 in 2012 to more than 73,000 in 2020. The cause was a species of mosquito that came from south Asia and the Arabian peninsula into Africa.
The Anopheles stephensi mosquito has since been detected in Ethiopia, Sudan, Somalia and Kenya, as well as Nigeria and Ghana in west Africa. According to one study, if this mosquito is left unchecked an additional 126 million people on the continent will be at risk of malaria.
It is a big threat because it thrives in urban environments, unlike other malaria-carrying mosquitoes in Africa that primarily breed in rural areas. Cities in Africa are growing rapidly, with more than half of Africans predicted to be urban dwellers by 2035.
Anopheles stephensi has also been found to be resistant to many of the insecticides used to control mosquito populations. They bite in the evening before most people’s bedtime – not in the middle of the night like other mosquitoes – making bed nets less effective as protection.
The government of Djibouti – aware of the work to develop and deploy GM mosquitoes to fight invasive species that spread dengue fever in Brazil – has partnered with Oxitec to tackle the threat.
In the laboratory, once every egg has been injected with the DNA, they are taken to a warm and humid room in which the conditions are ripe for them to mature into adults.

White shelves line the walls; on one side of the room are trays of water with mosquito larvae in them, while on the adjacent wall are plastic boxes filled with fully grown insects. One box has a contraption containing blood on top for the female mosquitoes to feed on. Inside the box the mosquitoes’ bottoms are pointing up, a sign that these insects carry the parasite that causes malaria.
It takes four or five days for the 5-30% of the eggs that usually survive the injection to hatch into larvae. In total, an egg typically takes about 14 days to develop into an adult mosquito.
In another room a few doors down, Anna Schoenauer, a team leader, is also glued to a microscope. When she shines blue light on the slide, a group of mosquitoes, magnified on a screen, can be seen wriggling around, glowing fluorescent green. This is as a result of a marker that they were injected with alongside the DNA, to signify whether they are carrying the altered gene.
The lab-produced mosquitoes carry a “self-limiting” gene that blocks normal cellular processes, which means if they mate, any female offspring will die. The male progeny, which do not bite, will survive and go on to mate with other wild females. With sustained releases of these “friendly mosquitoes”, more females die off, greatly reducing the mosquito population and the spread of malaria.
Scientists at Oxitec and malaria and mosquito experts insist these mosquitoes are safe. After evaluating the risk, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2016 and the US Environmental Protection Agency in 2022 confirmed that the mosquitoes did not pose a threat to humans or the environment.
There are no results published yet from the work going on in Djibouti, and Grey Frandsen, chief executive officer at Oxitec, acknowledges that much work remains to be done.
“We’re working on the invasive species but there are multiple species that transmit malaria,” he says. “There is no silver bullet in the malaria fight.”
Currently, most of the funding going into technologies such as this comes from international donors and philanthropists. With the Trump administration’s shutdown of USAID, the landscape for international humanitarian work has changed, but Frandsen is undeterred.
“We recognise what’s happening, and the impact it might be having on the international health community, but this is our time to shine,” he says.
“This is when disruptive tools are needed the most. This is where new technologies have to now play a more important role than ever.”",534.0,12.136363636363637,0.14330657768157767,0.3570316257816258,13.17,179.0,4.068181818181818,48.43,12.1,14.5,10.8,13.2,8.88,15.5,48.51,13.0,75.8,2.1329588014981273,6.544943820224719,0.704119850187266

UNAIDS said “the overall global AIDS response is facing a severe shock and many of the gains made in the past few decades are at risk of being reversed.” It said the restructuring follows an independent panel’s recommendations calling for “downsizing” its secretariat in Geneva while continuing to “prioritize the most essential functions.” It said it would maintain its presence in 36 countries.
Drastic U.S. cuts in assistance under the current Trump administration, part of wider cuts for global health, strike perhaps the biggest blow ever to the world’s efforts to fight HIV.
UNAIDS had previously warned that unless support to its HIV efforts are restored soon, more than 6 million additional people could die in the next four years and an additional 2,000 people per day could become infected with the virus that causes AIDS.
Employees were told at an internal town hall Tuesday that staff will be reduced to about 280 to 300 from about 600 currently, participants said.
UNAIDS officials were considering plans to move many posts to lower-cost locations where it already has offices: in Bonn, Germany; Nairobi, Kenya; or Johannesburg, South Africa — the country with the world’s highest number of AIDS cases, agency spokesperson Charlotte Sector told the AP.
The agency was created in 1996, largely to address shortcomings in global HIV policy by another U.N. health agency, the World Health Organization, which continues to partially fund UNAIDS.
The United States, under the second Trump administration, has sharply reduced or paused international funding and support for many U.N.-related organizations.
In an interview with the AP in February in response to the U.S. cuts, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said HIV infections could jump more than six times by 2029 if American support of the biggest AIDS program is dropped. She warned that more resistant strains of the disease could emerge.
Byanyima acknowledged some valid criticism regarding how HIV aid has been delivered and called it “an opportunity to rethink and develop more efficient ways of delivering life-saving support.”
According to its website, support from the United States contributed more than 40% of the UNAIDS core program and non-core activities that totaled about $214 million in 2023, the most recent year listed. Other top contributors included the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK.

66,https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/14749828/trump-bans-risky-virus-research-covid-china/,"DONALD Trump has banned all US funding for risky virus research in China and beyond, five years after Covid-19 upended the planet.
In a blistering executive order signed Monday, Trump outlawed federal support for gain-of-function experiments in countries like China and Iran — blaming the controversial research for unleashing the global health catastrophe.

The US President said in the Oval Office: “I said that right from day one it leaked out — whether it was to the girlfriend or somebody else, [a] scientist walked outside to have lunch with the girlfriend or was together with a lot of people — but that’s how it leaked out in my opinion.
“I’ve never changed that opinion, so it can leak out innocently, stupidly and incompetently, but innocently and half destroy the world.”
The dramatic order pulls the plug on ""any present and all future"" funding for experiments that make viruses more infectious or deadly - a field many scientists call ""dual-use"" research due to its potential military and public health impacts.
It will also appoint the National Institutes of Health and other agencies to sniff out and shut down bio-research posing a threat to public safety or national security.
According to a White House fact sheet, the measures will ""drastically reduce the potential for lab-related incidents involving gain-of-function research, like that conducted on bat coronaviruses in China by the EcoHealth Alliance and Wuhan Institute of Virology.""
The move comes amid a renewed global spotlight on the origins of Covid-19.
There has been a growing consensus among US intelligence agencies including the FBI, Department of Energy, and the CIA that a lab leak in Wuhan is the likeliest explanation.
Trump’s team tore into the Biden administration for failing to slam the brakes earlier on risky foreign experiments that “half destroyed the world.”
“Many people believe that gain-of-function research was one of the key causes of the Covid pandemic that struck us in the last decade,” said White House secretary Will Scharf.
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hailed it as “a historic day” and “the end of gain-of-function research funding by the federal government.”
What is gain-of-function research?
GAIN-of-function (GoF) research involves altering an organism — typically a virus or bacterium — to give it new or enhanced abilities.
When it comes to viruses, this often means making them:• More transmissible (spread more easily between people or animals)• More virulent (cause more severe illness)• Able to infect new species (including humans)
The goal is usually to better understand how pathogens evolve or to develop vaccines and treatments.
For example, scientists might tweak a flu virus to see how it could mutate to jump from birds to humans — giving researchers a head start on fighting future outbreaks.
But GoF research is highly controversial because of the risk it could create a supervirus that escapes the lab — whether accidentally or deliberately — and triggers a pandemic, as many fear happened with Covid-19.
“This dangerous game of function research, which aims at taking pathogens and making them more virulent, more transmissible on humans, many scientists believe is responsible for the COVID pandemic,” added NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya.
“This research does not protect us against pandemics, as some people might say. There’s always a danger that in doing this research, it might leak out,” he said.
“The vast majority of science will go on under this as normal.”
The Covid-19 pandemic, which killed more than seven million people worldwide and over one million Americans, has long been surrounded by suspicion over its origins.
Though former NIH boss Dr. Francis Collins and ex-NIAID chief Dr. Anthony Fauci insist the virus likely jumped naturally from animals to humans, others — including former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield — have backed the lab leak theory.
It comes after The Sun’s explosive Covid lab leak documentary laid bare the mounting evidence and disturbing questions surrounding the virus's emergence in Wuhan — home to China’s most secretive bio-research facility.
The new crackdown also follows an explosive congressional report last December, which concluded Covid ""most likely leaked from a lab in Wuhan"" - implicating China, US officials, and scientific institutions in a cover-up.
The report also revealed the DOJ had probed the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance - accused of funnelling US taxpayer cash to the Wuhan lab through projects like “Understanding the Risk of Bat Coronavirus Emergence.”
The program, funded by NIAID and USAID between 2014 and 2021, led to gain-of-function research, according to former The National Institutes of Health (NIH) deputy director Dr. Lawrence Tabak — though officials have denied any direct Covid link.
Another proposal, Project DEFUSE, submitted by EcoHealth president Dr. Peter Daszak to DARPA, sought to create chimeric bat coronaviruses — and has since been labelled the “smoking gun” by lab leak proponents.
Though never funded, former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) chief Redfield has warned such projects may still have been tested under other grants.

Daszak, who testified before Congress last year, admitted China’s biosafety rules were weaker than America’s — and said he lacked access to key genomic data from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
He has fiercely denied any link between EcoHealth and the outbreak, branding lab-leak theorists “conspiracy theorists” — a stance echoed by Fauci.
But the Department of Defense’s own watchdog found the US has struggled to track how much gain-of-function research it’s helped fund — citing “significant limitations” and noting such work could qualify as “offensive biological” research.
An audit sparked by Sen. Joni Ernst found at least seven grants worth more than $15.5 million were channelled through subrecipients to Chinese or other foreign labs.
The Pentagon’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency handed over another $46.7 million to EcoHealth Alliance alone.
“I have been fighting for years to end the insane practice of sending tax dollars to China for sketchy pseudoscience,” said Ernst.
“Thankfully, President Trump is ending the batty experiments, like those conducted in Wuhan, that are dangerous and wasteful.”
The executive order pauses all infectious pathogen and toxin research until a new enforcement policy is drawn up by Office of Science and Technology boss Michael Kratsios and acting National Security adviser Marco Rubio.
It also comes just days after the US released a bombshell new website on Covid origins - pointing the finger squarely at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
In a desperate propaganda push, China hit back last week with a bizarre White Paper claiming the virus may have started in the US — accusing America of “spreading misinformation” and “scapegoating” Beijing for its own failures.
The document insists Covid “might have emerged in the United States earlier than its officially-claimed timeline” and slams the US for “indifference and delayed actions.”
But the evidence — and global pressure — continues to mount.
“This is a great win for the American people and common sense,” said Ernst.

“Aspergillus species cause severe infections in humans, livestock, and plants,” according to a pre-print from the University of Manchester, home to the largest center for research into fungi and respiratory infections.

“Fungal pathogens pose a serious threat to human health by causing infections and disrupting food systems.” Viv Goosens, research manager at Wellcome Trust, which funded the research, told Sky News. “Climate change will make these risks worse. To address these challenges, we must fill important research gaps.”
The problem, the research says, is that global warming is encouraging the growth of the fungus; Analysis of the research in Financial Times explains that Aspergillus flavus, which impacts crops, could spread up to 16% by 2100.
Another type of fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus — which causes infections in those with asthma and other disorders — could cover 77% more ground by 2100.
Aspergillus fumigatus causes aspergillosis, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which names it “the leading cause of invasive mold infections in people.” It’s also treatment resistant, and the CDC explains people infected with Aspergillus fumigatus are “33% more likely to die.”
Rising global temperatures fuel the fungus, which grows “astonishingly quickly” in heat, Exeter University's Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology told FT.

“​​We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions,” Dr. Norman van Rhijn, lead author of the study and a research fellow at the University of Manchester, told FT. “In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different.”

69,https://www.foodandwine.com/plastic-chemicals-phthalates-heart-disease-11728481,"A new study is shining a light on just how impactful phthalates — the chemicals used to make plastics more flexible — can be on human health.
In late April, researchers from New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine published their findings in the journal eBioMedicine, showing that these common phthalates may be linked to hundreds of thousands of heart disease deaths in a single year.
Here’s what you need to know.
As the National Resources Defence Council explains, phthalates are a “family of chemicals” that are added to plastics that make them soft, malleable, or clingy (aka clingwrap). You’ll find them in just about everything, from food containers to cosmetics, as well as toys, toothbrushes, the coating of some medications, and even in cleaning products, since they help retain scent.
But here’s the big issue: These phthalates don’t remain in place. According to Toxic-Free Future, “Because phthalates are not chemically bound to the plastic they are used in, they migrate out over time and contaminate indoor dust and air. People are exposed to phthalates through indoor dust and air, from using products such as cosmetics, and from food.”
The NYU researchers focused on a specific phthalate, di‑2‑ethylhexyl phthalate, also known as DEHP, examining its impact on human health by analyzing population surveys that included urine samples collected in 2008 and cardiovascular death records from 2018. From here, they were able to build a “disease burden” model, estimating that DEHP exposure among 55–64 year olds accounted for more than 356,000 deaths worldwide in 2018, or about 13.5% of all heart‑disease fatalities in that age group.
“Phthalates contribute to inflammation and systemic inflammation in the coronary arteries, which can accelerate existing disease and lead to acute events including mortality,” Dr. Leonardo Trasande, a professor of pediatrics and population health at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine and senior author on the study, shared with CNN. “Phthalates are known to disrupt testosterone … low testosterone is a predictor of adult cardiovascular disease,” he added.
However, the authors also found that not all global regions were affected equally. South Asia and the Middle East suffered the most, with 148,500 deaths, while East Asia and the Pacific accounted for an additional 112,000.
The United States and Europe fared somewhat better, with the researchers finding that DEHP exposure contributed to approximately 10% and 8% of heart disease deaths, respectively. Overall, the study estimated that 10.47 million years of life were lost globally in 2018 due to DEHP’s impact on cardiovascular health.
“There is a clear disparity in which parts of the world bear the brunt of heightened heart risks from phthalates,” Trasande added in a statement.
This isn’t the only study linking phthalates to human health issues. A 2022 review study found “robust evidence for an association with lower semen quality, neurodevelopment and risk of childhood asthma, and moderate to robust evidence for impact on anogenital distance in boys.” It also found an association between phthalates and low birthweight, endometriosis, ADHD, Type 2 diabetes, as well as breast and uterine cancer.
Another study conducted in 2021 found that “chronic exposure to phthalates will adversely influence the endocrine system and functioning of multiple organs, which has negative long-term impacts on the success of pregnancy, child growth and development, and reproductive systems in both young children and adolescents.”
While eliminating plastics entirely is no easy feat, you can make a few small changes to reduce your exposure. This includes switching food storage containers to glass or stainless steel and avoiding microwaving plastic. Rethinking your use of single-use plastics can also help, such as avoiding plastic water bottles and straws.
You can also try a little “phthalate cleanse.” A 2011 study tracked 20 participants and asked them to eat only fresh, non-packaged foods for three days, testing their urine before and after the “diet.” Those who followed the protocol observed a 53–56% average reduction in DEHP metabolites over three days.
The authors noted that their findings “underscore the critical need for enhanced regulatory measures and international cooperation to mitigate the health impacts of phthalates, particularly in regions characterised by high levels of industrialisation and plastic consumption.” They note that their modeling “provides concrete estimates of only a small fraction of those risks, emphasising the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the health impacts of plastic exposure.” However, if you don’t want to wait for this change to happen, you can always take charge by taking the small steps outlined above.",414.0,18.0,0.046163613172541744,0.3878200371057513,14.4,138.0,6.0,40.18,13.2,15.1,13.81,15.7,10.06,16.0,55.7,16.0,59.79,2.1956521739130435,6.956521739130435,0.7294685990338164

71,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/apr/30/access-antibiotics-superbugs-research-drug-resistant-infections,"Less than 7% of people with severe drug-resistant infections in poorer countries get the antibiotics they need, a new study suggests, with researchers warning that not only is this causing suffering and deaths, but is also likely to be driving antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
With AMR forecast to cause 1.9m deaths a year by 2050, they are calling for urgent action, akin to the fight earlier this century to get HIV drugs to Africa’s virus hotspots.
“The stark reality is that most people with highly drug-resistant infections are not getting access to the antibiotics they need,” said Dr Jennifer Cohn, a senior author of the study.
AMR is a process whereby bacteria and other pathogens evolve resistance to treatments typically used against them. One driver is the overuse of antibiotics, with greater exposure to drugs offering bacteria more chances to learn how to evade them.
But a focus on overuse has meant access has been neglected, the experts warn.
The study, published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases, is the first to quantify the treatment gap in low- and middle-income countries. It was led by the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership (GardP).
Researchers focused on Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kenya, Mexico, Pakistan and South Africa, and used modelling data on the number of cases of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative (CRGN) infections, which are drug-resistant and on the rise. They then looked at sales data for eight types of antibiotic that could be used as treatment.
Across the eight countries, there were an estimated 1.5m CRGN infections and almost 480,000 deaths in 2019. Just under 104,000 courses of antibiotics active against CRGNs were procured.
Appropriate antibiotics were available in only 6.9% of cases on average – ranging from 0.2% in Kenya to 14.9% in Mexico and Egypt.
Cohn, GardP’s global access director, said it was a pattern likely to be repeated in other poorer nations.
The infections in the study included pneumonias, bloodstream infections and complicated urinary tract infections.
The “No 1 thing” the lack of drugs did was to drive morbidity and mortality, Cohn stressed, but it could also drive AMR. Trying other, ineffective antibiotics, was likely to mean a longer duration of antibiotic use – linked in studies to increases in resistant bacteria. Killing drug-resistant bacteria with the correct treatment would stop them spreading.
There were many factors behind the treatment gap, she said. Sick people may not make it to a hospital for diagnosis, or those who do may not be able to afford treatments.
“We are focusing introduction of newer antibiotics in the US and in a few countries in Europe. That’s not where the burden is,” she said.
“We are really trying to change the narrative to say we can’t just focus on stewardship, surveillance and containment in low- and middle-income communities, while we’re focused on just innovation in high-income countries. We actually have to focus on both all at once, in all places.”

Mechanisms that worked well for HIV could be applied for AMR, Cohn said. GardP is working with the pharmaceutical company Shionogi to use voluntary licensing (allowing generic drugs to be manufactured) to speed up global access to cefiderocol, which can treat some resistant infections.
The research team called for treatment targets like the “care cascade” set by HIV global policymakers aiming for at least 95% of people with HIV to be diagnosed, 95% of people with HIV to be on antiretroviral treatment and 95% of those to have the virus under control by 2030.
Cohn said she had been surprised to hear views about “the inability of certain countries to actually be able to use [antibiotics] appropriately”.
“I just don’t think that’s true,” she said. Even in well-resourced healthcare systems it could be hard to diagnose and treat bacterial infections. “Access is important everywhere. No matter how you slice it, there is a big access gap.”
Prof Alison Holmes of the University of Liverpool, who leads the global Centres for Antimicrobial Optimisation Network, said the study “should prompt immediate action”.
She said: “If these critical gaps in access and care are not urgently addressed, the burden of antimicrobial resistance will continue to rise, leading to more preventable deaths, worsening patient outcomes and an already devastating global health crisis becoming even more inequitable.”",390.0,12.1875,0.06584217171717173,0.46545472582972597,12.37,129.0,4.03125,43.93,11.8,13.9,11.95,12.7,9.15,16.25,47.2,12.0,56.53,2.2153846153846155,6.723076923076923,0.6974358974358974

Aspergillus, a mould that can cause respiratory and lung issues if it infects a person, may infect millions of people each year if it spreads to more northern nations in Europe, Asia, and America as a result of rising temperatures.

The growth of fungal pathogens, which can flourish in a wide range of settings, including homes, is approaching a tipping point, according to Norman van Rhijn, a Wellcome Trust research fellow at Manchester University who co-authored the study.
He stated that fungal infections will be a factor in millions of deaths across the globe each year.
Aspergillosis, also known as a lung disease caused by spores of Aspergillus, which can spread to other human organs, is one such disease.
The disease is difficult to diagnose due to its hard-to-detect spores, meaning there's a shortage of treatments for the diseases they trigger, and they are growing resistance to existing drugs.
Speaking to the Financial Times, Van Rhijn said: ""We’re talking about hundreds of thousands of lives, and continental shifts in species distributions.
""In 50 years, where things grow and what you get infected by is going to be completely different.""
Despite being a dangerous fungal mould, it can have positive benefits as it is used in industrial and food production, including the fermentation of soy sauce and sake.
It was revealed that inhaling its spores does not make everyone ill, but it can be particularly threatening to those with conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis or an immune-compromised system.
In the latest research, it was revealed by the Financial Times that Aspergillus fumigatus could spread across an additional 77 per cent of the territory by the year 2100 due to the world's heavy use of fossil fuels.
This means that it could potentially expose nine million people in Europe to infection.
The species flourishes in the 37C internal temperature of the human body, which can be explained by its ability to develop swiftly in high temperatures in compost.
It was named as one of four critical fungal pathogens that posed the highest risk by the World Health Organization in 2022.
Professor Elaine Bignell, co-director at the MRC Centre for Medical Mycology at Exeter University, said: ""Its lifestyle in the natural environment may have provided Aspergillus fumigatus with the fitness advantage needed to colonise human lungs.""
Another species, Aspergillus flavus, lives on crops and could spread to an added 16 per cent of territory in north China, Russia, Scandinavia, and Alaska by 2100, researchers added.
Some existing areas in African countries and Brazil may also be made inhospitable, which could be damaging to local ecosystems.
Darius Armstrong-James, professor of infectious diseases and medical mycology at Imperial College London, told the Financial Times: ""There are serious threats from this organism both in terms of human health and food security.""
It was also discovered that the disease produces damaging chemicals called aflatoxins that can cause cancers or life-threatening liver damage

73,https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/aspergillus-killer-fungus-spread-j8wg6lrhk,"A killer fungus that infects millions of people a year is likely to spread because of rising temperatures, new climate change research claims.
Aspergillus could reach more northerly countries in Europe, Asia and America, according to a study funded by the Wellcome Trust.
Researchers forecast that there will be an increased risk of infection from fungi, including a significant spread of some fungal pathogens across Europe. The extent of this will depend on global actions to mitigate climate change, as a lack of action to cut fossil fuel reliance puts more people at risk over the next 15 years, the research claims.
The spread of Aspergillus flavus, for example, could increase by about 16 per cent, putting 1 million more people at risk of infection in Europe. Infections affect the respiratory system, and the fungus also infects a broad range of agricultural crops.
The spread of another fungus, Aspergillus fumigatus, could increase by 77.5 per cent and potentially expose 9 million people in Europe to infection.
It is estimated that fungal infections are already a factor in millions of deaths worldwide each year. One leading danger is aspergillosis, a lung disease caused by spores that can spread to other organs.
The trust said this was a concerning trend because of rising resistance to antifungal drugs and a severe lack of diagnostic tests and treatments for fungal infections.
• Can these mushroom detectives find the next penicillin?
The study, published on a platform called Research Square, maps the effects of rising temperatures on infection-causing fungi under different climate change mitigation scenarios until the year 2100. The research was led by Norman van Rhijn at the University of Manchester.
He said: “Changes in environmental factors, such as humidity and extreme weather events, will change habitats and drive fungal adaptation and spread.
“We’ve already seen the emergence of the fungus Candida auris due to rising temperatures, but, until now, we had little information of how other fungi might respond to this change in the environment. Fungi are relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites, but these maps show that fungal pathogens will likely impact most areas of the world in the future.
“Raising awareness and developing effective interventions for fungal pathogens will be essential to mitigate the consequences of this.”
Many fungal infections have high mortality rates, partly because of the lack of diagnostics, vaccines and treatment options, but also a lack of awareness. Additionally, as fungi are more similar to humans than other pathogens, developing anti-fungal treatments without toxic side effects is challenging.
Temperatures in Africa could become so high that some fungi would not be able to survive on the continent, affecting functioning ecosystems. Antifungal resistance is also being driven by the use of fungicides in agricultureto protect crops and support food production.
Viv Goosens, research manager at Wellcome, said: “Fungal pathogens pose a serious threat to human health by causing infections and disrupting food systems. Climate change will make these risks worse. To address these challenges, we must fill important research gaps. By using models and maps to track the spread of fungi, we can better direct resources and prepare for the future.”
Fungal infections are transmitted through fungal spores in the air we breathe. People with weakened immune systems and other risk factors are most vulnerable to infections, although fungi could adapt to become more pathogenic due to rising temperatures, which could result in more infections in healthy people.
Despite this mounting threat, fungal infections receive little attention or resources. Fewer than a tenth of an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million species have been described, and a tiny fraction have had their genome sequenced. Wellcome is awarding more than £50 million in funding towards fungal research over the next year.",367.0,13.107142857142858,0.1296182412358883,0.47673945335710044,11.84,100.0,3.5714285714285716,43.93,11.8,13.2,13.29,13.4,9.15,15.25,50.85,12.0,49.24,2.092643051771117,6.866485013623978,0.6730245231607629

The findings, based on rapid WHO assessment of the fast-evolving situation, raise concern for potentially deeper and prolonged effects on health systems and services across the world, especially in vulnerable and fragile settings. This requires urgent action and international response.
The new rapid stock take conducted in March–April 2025 with 108 WHO country offices, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, shows that many countries are working to increase or reallocate funding from domestic and alternative external sources to address gaps. However, up to 24% of WHO Country Office responses suggest budget cuts are already translating into increased out-of-pocket payments. The poor and vulnerable likely risk bearing the additional brunt of these impacts.
“These results paint a worrying picture about the impact of the sudden and unplanned cuts to aid on the health of millions of people,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Although these cuts are a shock, they are also driving an accelerated transition away from aid dependency to a more sustainable self-reliance, based on domestic resources. Many countries are asking for WHO’s support, and WHO is working with them to identify and tailor the most effective measures.”
The stock take reports provide an early snapshot and insights from WHO country offices that work closely with ministries of health, providing regular support on health systems policies and planning.

At an interactive side event during the 24th Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), Indigenous leaders, health experts and advocates gathered to explore the guiding principles and priority areas for actions that will shape the Global Plan of Action (GPA) for the health of Indigenous Peoples. Co-hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Permanent Mission of Brazil, the event marked a step in advancing World Health Assembly Resolution 76.16, which calls for stronger rights-based action to address health disparities faced by Indigenous Peoples worldwide. Moderated by Geoffrey Roth (Lakota, Standing Rock and Member of the UNPFII), speakers and participants at the event emphasized that the GPA must be developed with Indigenous Peoples, not for them, and must reflect Indigenous conceptualizations of health, considering self-determination, culturally grounded healing systems and ancestral knowledge.
A major theme of the event was the need for Indigenous leadership to guide the design, implementation and monitoring of the Global Plan, with speakers emphasizing that Indigenous Peoples, including those at the grassroots level, must be meaningfully involved. “Access means a meaningful and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples, including in this WHO global action plan,” said Binota Moy Dhamai, member of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP). “Their right to self-determination, protection of their land and territory, recognition of knowledge systems on traditional medicine, and Indigenous-led governance are crucial for maintaining Indigenous Peoples' health.” Some concerns were raised about access to global mechanisms, which are often not user friendly and can exclude entire communities of people. Many highlighted the urgent need for Indigenous Peoples to be included in key discussions.
Discussions also emphasized that Indigenous Peoples’ full conceptualizations of health, including the holistic connection rooted in balance with the land, spirit and communities, must be central to the GPA. “As an Indigenous woman, I don’t speak about myself first but about my land, my place, my ancestors,” said Emma Rawson Te-Patu, President of the World Federation of Public Health Associations. Such a holistic conceptualization includes addressing mental health concerns in ways that are community-informed and safeguard Indigenous medicinal knowledge and practices. It also involves the protection and promotion of traditional medicine systems as a whole; the safeguarding of Indigenous lands and languages; and the centring and embedding of ancestral knowledge into universal health coverage (UHC) and climate resilience strategies. Health systems must acknowledge not only individuals but also their ancestors, lands and communities as essential sources of healing and knowledge.
Speakers called for practical collaboration across UN agencies and international frameworks to avoid fragmentation. WHO was urged to coordinate closely with related initiatives on biodiversity, traditional medicine and knowledge, climate change and desertification. WHO’s Global Traditional Medicine Centre was identified as an important mechanism to support the delivery of the Global Plan.
Another strong recommendation was the establishment of a high-level Indigenous advisory body to guide and oversee the Plan’s development and implementation. Such a body would safeguard and promote human rights-based approaches to health, informed consent and sustainable Indigenous-led community funding mechanisms in implementing and monitoring the GPA.
This event marked a clear call to move beyond dialogue and toward broader and sustained accountable partnerships that centre Indigenous voices in shaping their own health and well-being. It also emphasized the need for global and country health strategies to honour Indigenous knowledge and resilience. As Geoffrey Roth noted in his opening remarks, “We have the wisdom. We have the solutions. What we need now is sustained commitment.”",386.0,17.545454545454547,0.11847572362278244,0.3897992530345472,16.5,148.0,6.7272727272727275,19.2,17.2,17.7,16.77,20.1,9.91,70.0,65.9,17.0,56.15,2.406735751295337,7.463730569948186,0.6321243523316062

The report shines a spotlight on the daily challenges individuals face – from delayed diagnoses to unaffordable or unavailable inhaled medicines – as well as the life-changing benefits of timely and effective treatment.
More than 250 million people worldwide are living with asthma – a significant global health burden. This year’s World Asthma Day theme, “Make inhaled treatments accessible for all,” reinforces the urgency of ensuring universal access to affordable, quality-assured asthma medicines. Despite decades of evidence showing that inhaled treatments — including bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids — reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent deaths, access remains inadequate in many low- and middle-income countries.
Asthma inhalers are included in the  WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, are core medicines in the  WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease (NCD) interventions for primary health care, and are included in the WHO “Best Buys” for NCDs.
The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) is launching a campaign to raise awareness of these  gaps and is calling on Heads of State and global health leaders to invest in solutions that make inhaled treatments available to everyone who needs them.
The upcoming fourth United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs, to be held in September 2025, offers a pivotal moment for Heads of State and Government, UN partners, Ministers of Health, civil society and donors to strengthen existing commitments to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one third by 2030.
“By prioritizing equitable access to medicines and strengthening primary healthcare systems, countries can not only meet global NCD targets but also enjoy significant economic and social returns,” said José Luis Castro, WHO Director General’s Special Envoy for Chronic Respiratory Diseases. “Improved asthma care leads to better health outcomes, enhanced education performance, and increased participation in the labour market.”
WHO continues to lead global efforts to address chronic respiratory diseases.  Through its Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), WHO works with partners such as FIRS, GAN and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), to strengthen global advocacy and technical support for countries.
“The work of our longstanding, valued partners is vital,” said Dr Sarah Rylance, technical lead for chronic respiratory diseases at WHO. “Together, we are amplifying critical evidence-based messages and driving progress to ensure that every person with asthma – no matter where they live – can breathe freely.”
WHO is currently updating the guidance on the diagnosis and management of asthma in primary care.

84,https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/life-sciences-and-health-care-industry-outlooks/2025-global-health-care-executive-outlook.html,"The global health care workforce shortage is expected to continue in 2025, especially in low- and lower-middle-income countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortfall of 10 million health care workers by 2030.6 More than 80% of the surveyed health care executives expect to see external workforce challenges this year, such as hiring difficulties and talent shortages. Consequently, survey respondents said it will be important for their organizations to invest in retention and engagement strategies.
This need for investment in workforce retention and engagement is underscored by recent events. In early 2024, more than 12,000 junior doctors in South Korea went on strike, seeking better working conditions and fewer hours. South Korea has one of the lowest ratios of doctors to population in the developed world, with just 2.6 clinicians per 1,000 people.7 Later in 2024, junior doctors from England's National Health Service (NHS) engaged in a prolonged strike for higher pay and better working conditions, resulting in the cancellation of more than 1.5 million appointments, according to the NHS.8 In New Zealand, about 36,000 nurses, health care assistants, and midwives went on strike in December 2024, calling for higher pay, increased staffing, improved patient safety.9 Burnout among clinical staff, often due to prolonged stress from demanding work conditions, can decrease productivity, reduce job satisfaction, and negatively impact patient care.10
Health systems, whether public or private, are businesses. However, unlike other businesses that view their employees as assets, health care workers are sometimes overlooked in resource allocation decisions, especially when budgets are tight. Nevertheless, prioritizing the health and well-being of staff across the organization can lead to cost reductions by decreasing burnout and boosting retention rates. This approach can help boost productivity among existing staff while stabilizing expenses related to hiring and onboarding new employees.
Reducing administrative burdens should be a priority for health system leaders. Research has shown that these low-value tasks contribute to clinician burnout.11 An estimated 15% to 28% of nurses’ work is made up of low-value tasks. Doctors who work in hospital intensive care units might spend as little as 15% to 30% of their time with patients,12 with the rest spent on administrative tasks such as updating medical records. Digital tools have the potential to streamline some of those tasks, giving physicians and other clinicians more time to interact directly with patients, which could help reduce burnout.
According to a model developed by the Deloitte US Center for Health Solutions, technology can free up between 13% and 21% of nurses’ time, which translates to 240 to 400 hours per year for a single nurse. Many health systems operate on tight budgets and often don’t have enough clinical staff to meet demand. Can technology change that? Some digital tools that are already widely available can reduce the time nurses spend on administrative tasks by 20%, allowing them to devote more time to their patients, according to Deloitte US research.",283.0,16.647058823529413,0.10394904009034445,0.3937276491624318,13.38,93.0,5.470588235294118,43.32,12.0,14.4,14.1,14.5,9.92,12.0,53.08,12.0,39.69,2.1448763250883394,6.989399293286219,0.7067137809187279

The United States spent roughly US$12 billion on global health in 2024. Without that yearly spending, roughly 25 million people could die in the next 15 years, according to models that have estimated the impact of such cuts on programmes for tuberculosis, HIV, family planning and maternal and child health.
The United States has long been the largest donor for health initiatives in poor countries, accounting for almost one-quarter of all global health assistance from donors. These investments have contributed to consistent public-health gains for more than a decade. HIV deaths, for example, dropped by 51% globally between 2010 and 2023, and deaths owing to tuberculosis dropped by 23% between 2015 and 2023.
But the administration of US President Donald Trump has cut billions of dollars of spending for global health, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and freezing foreign-aid contributions — some of which has been temporarily restored.
Researchers have been trying to study the potential impact of the funding cuts. John Stover, an infectious-diseases modeller at Avenir Health, a global-health organization in Glastonbury, Connecticut, and his colleagues used mathematical models to estimate health outcomes, should all US funding for global health be cut and not replaced, compared with outcomes if funding provided in 2024 were to continue through to 2040. The results were posted on the preprint server SSRN earlier this month and have not been peer reviewed1.

The researchers “use a combination of robust, well-established and proven mathematical models and analytical approaches to estimate the impact”, says Andrew Vallely, a clinical epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “Their findings are devastating to read” and “a wake-up call for all of us working in global health.”
James Trauer, an infectious-disease modeller at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, adds: “These models are probably as good as we have available at the moment for predicting the direct effects of the funding cuts on these various programmes.”
On 28 March, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that the government was reorienting its foreign-assistance programmes to align with the country’s priorities. “We are continuing essential life-saving programmes and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.”
The researchers modelled the impact of cutting the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the 55 countries it supports, including stopping the delivery of treatments, tests and interventions that prevent transmission. The programme has been affected by funding freezes.
Without PEPFAR, there would be 15 million more deaths from AIDS by 2040 than if the programme continued (see ‘A world without US aid’). More than 60% of those deaths would take place in six African countries, including Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. Roughly 14 million extra children would become orphans as a result of those AIDS deaths — a trend that had been expected to decrease over the next 15 years. And 26 million more people could become infected with HIV without PEPFAR.
Source: Stover/Preprints with The Lancet
The impact varies considerably depending on how reliant a country is on US government support, says Stover. In Uganda, for example, 65% of funding for HIV research comes from the United States, he says. Some models estimated the effects of a partial-funding scenario; in this case, continuing funding for treatment alone could avert 97% of the extra deaths and 90% of the extra new HIV infections.
The global number of infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis — the bacterium that causes the world’s deadliest infectious disease — is also expected to ramp up without US aid funding. Researchers looked at the impact of cuts to USAID and US contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria across 79 low- and middle-income countries — although it is not yet clear by how much US contributions to the fund will shrink in the coming years. These would contribute to 69 million more M. tuberculosis infections and 2 million more deaths by 2040.
These estimates are broadly consistent with other efforts to assess the impact, says Trauer.
“There’s been tremendous progress made in global health over the last couple of decades and we’re at risk of losing a lot of that,” says Katherine Horton, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who contributed to the modelling on tuberculosis.",402.0,15.461538461538462,0.06420110192837467,0.3215289256198347,14.46,123.0,4.730769230769231,37.94,14.1,15.0,13.41,16.5,9.65,16.0,56.79,15.0,59.05,2.181592039800995,6.840796019900497,0.6467661691542289

An epidemic of a new variant of clade I mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), called clade 1b,[2] began in Central Africa at least as early as September 2023.[3][4] As of September 2024[update], more than 29,000 cases have been reported, with over 800 fatalities (~3% fatality rate),[1] nearly all in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.[5] According to the European CDC: ""The size of these outbreaks could be larger than reported due to under-ascertainment and under-reporting.""[6]
On 14 August 2024, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern.[2][7][8]
Mpox is an infectious viral disease that is endemic among small mammals in central areas of Africa; it can also infect humans.[9] Symptoms include a rash that forms blisters and then crusts over, fever, and swollen lymph nodes.[9] The illness is usually mild, and most infected individuals recover within a few weeks without treatment.[10] However, cases may be severe, especially in children, pregnant women, or people with suppressed immune systems.[11]
In May 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a prior mpox outbreak, involving a clade IIb of the virus, a global health emergency. The disease had infected 87,000 individuals and caused 140 deaths when the WHO ended its global emergency in May 2023, citing a combination of vaccination and public health information as successful control measures.[12][13] Cases of clade IIb which can be traced to this outbreak are continuing to be detected worldwide, although at a relatively low level.[14]
In September 2023, cases of mpox started increasing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and continued into 2024. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (ACDC) reported a 160% increase in cases from the previous year. Most of these cases were determined to be caused by clade I of the virus.[3][15]
Mpox cases from clade Ib infections were growing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by September 2023,[3][4] with several of them being identified in Kamituga, a mining town in the province of South Kivu.[64][3][65] A nationwide outbreak was reported in January 2024.[3][66]
On 12 August 2024, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention declared that the growing mpox outbreaks in Africa had become a public health emergency, with over 517 deaths being reported. As a result, the organization requested the help and intervention of the international community to control the spread of the virus and treat infected patients.[5][67] The ACDC stated that the fatality rate of the strain of virus causing the outbreak was 3–4%, significantly higher than the less than 1% fatality rate recorded during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak.[5] On 14 August, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a public health emergency of international concern or global health emergency.[2][7]
As of 16 August 2024, fifteen countries were reported to have identified cases of mpox; and over 96% of all reported cases and fatalities from the disease were confirmed in the DRC, with 16,839 reported cases and 501 reported deaths.[5] The ACDC reported that 70% of reported cases in the DRC were in children under 15, as that demographic represented 85% of reported deaths.[5] Epidemiologist Jacques Alonda expressed concern over the disease's spread in refugee camps in the DRC and its neighbor countries, mainly due to the amount of pressure already applied to the national healthcare system by concurrent outbreaks of cholera and measles, as well as widespread malnutrition.[5]
Also on 16 August, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) officially raised the risk level of clade I to the general European population from ""very low"" to ""low"" due to the likelihood of more imported cases being identified across the continent, although the agency reiterated that the risk of sustained transmission of the virus strain in Europe was still considered to be minimum.[68][69] The ECDC also advised travellers to consider getting vaccinated against mpox should they visit African countries affected by the outbreak.[68][70]
As of 19 September 2024, 15 of the 55 member states of the African Union have reported cases according the Africa CDC.[71]  Rwanda started its vaccination campaign, while the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak, is set to start vaccinations in early October 2024.[72]
In October 2024, the WHO approved the first diagnostic test under the Emergency Use Listing (EUL) procedure. The Alinity m MPXV assay enables the detection of the virus by testing swabs of skin lesions.[73]
As of August 2024, a cumulative total of 16,839 suspected cases of mpox (at least 1,888 of which were laboratory confirmed)[17] and 570 deaths[74] (at least 8 of which were laboratory confirmed)[17] have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).[74]
On 19 August, the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba, said in a press conference that all of the country's provinces, including the capital city of Kinshasa, had been affected by the outbreak,[74] while announcing that the national government would launch a €45 million response plan including awareness campaigns, medical team deployment and patient care, but not vaccines.[74][75]
Various media reported that the impact of the mpox outbreak across the DRC, and especially in eastern provinces, had been significantly worsened by factors such as widespread conflicts in the region, including an offensive by the Rwanda-backed March 23 Movement in North Kivu— which had displaced thousands of civilians, most of whom had been forced to gather in refugee camps around Goma or in the city itself— , widespread extreme poverty, poor access to healthcare services, and the circulation of the infection within sex workers in illicit mining industries.[76][77][78] Medair's health advisor in the DRC, Pierre Olivier Ngadjole, said that around 70% of the new mpox cases registered in the Goma area between June and August 2024 had involved people living in displacement camps, while the director of the Bulengo refugee camp, Mahoro Faustin, expressed concerns over the lack of testing kits available in the area.[76][78]
As of August 2024, fifteen countries have reported cases of mpox; the WHO reported that new cases of the mpox strain, all of which linked to the outbreak in the DRC,[5] had been identified for the first time in four East African nations: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.[5] Ivory Coast also reported new cases for the first time.
On 30 July 2024, the Minister of Health of the Central African Republic, Pierre Somsé, declared an outbreak of mpox in Bangui  following a period when the disease was mostly restricted to rural areas.[79] Somsé reported that some families in the country were hiding infected relatives in fear of being stigmatized, thus increasing the risk of transmission of the disease.[79]
On 15 August 2024, Sweden's Public Health Agency reported the first case outside Africa, which involved a person who had contracted clade I mpox during a stay in an area of Africa affected by the outbreak.[22][80][81] In a public statement, the agency said that, while the case in itself did not represent a higher risk to the general population,[22][81] occasional imported cases ""may continue to occur"".[22][82]
On 18 August 2024, the Public Health Bureau of the city council of Tainan, Taiwan, announced that as of 16 August, three cases of mpox—all of which involved men who have had close contact with unspecified people—had been confirmed in the city since the start of the year; further details about the patients' traveling history and the variant were not disclosed.[83][84]
On 21 August 2024, Thailand's Department of Disease Control confirmed a mpox case involving a 66-year-old European man who was a resident of Thailand,[23][85] and had returned from an African country affected by the outbreak, with his flight transiting through an undisclosed Middle Eastern country.[23][85][86] The strain was later confirmed to be clade 1b.[87] The patient who tested positive for clade Ib was a European male who arrived in Bangkok last week from Africa, according to the Department of Disease Control of Thailand’s health ministry.[23]
By 9 January 2023, New Zealand had reported 41 cases of mpox.[88] The country had reported its first case of mpox on 9 July 2022.[89] By 15 August 2024, Health New Zealand (Te Whatu Ora) had confirmed that there had been 53 local cases of mpox since July 2022; with four being reported in 2024 in Auckland.[90]
Some countries have reported contemporary mpox cases that then turned out to be infections with clade II variants, presumably unrelated to the clade Ib outbreak. There is a global outbreak of clade II infections that began in 2022.
On 15 August 2024, Pakistan's National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) reported a suspected case of mpox in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,[4] involving a resident of Mardan who had recently returned from an Arab Gulf state;[91] the person was later confirmed to have been diagnosed with mpox by the Pakistani Ministry of Health, although sequencing of viral samples was still ongoing in order to determine the nature of the variant.[91][92][93]
On 17 August, the health department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa confirmed that two patients had tested positive for mpox, while another one was waiting for confirmation; all of the patients had recently returned to Pakistan from the United Arab Emirates.[54]
On 19 August, another suspected mpox case was reported, involving a resident of Azad Kashmir who had just returned from a Middle Eastern country; however, the Ministry of Health stated that none of the reported cases in the country had been caused by clade 1b of the virus.[55]
On 16 August, Portugal's Directorate-General of Health (DGS) confirmed that three new cases of mpox had been confirmed in the country between May and July 2024;[57][94] the agency reported that all of the cases had been detected in the North Region, with two of them having travelled abroad during the incubation period of the disease.[95] However, the DGS said that all of the three patients had contracted clade IIb mpox,[57] whereas no clade I cases had been reported.[57][94]
On 17 August 2024, Indonesia's Independence day, the national Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) reported a total of 14 confirmed mpox cases from January to April 2024.[47] This brought the cumulative total to 88 cases in Indonesia when combined with the previous outbreak's 73 cases reported in 2023, as well as one case from 2022.[47][96] The Indonesian government later reported a 100% recovery rate of all 88 confirmed cases since 2022.[97] The latest outbreak, which initially began in Jakarta, then spread to the Riau Islands. Among the total cases, 87 patients had been declared cured, with 54 cases involving the clade IIb variant. The distribution of cases by region included 59 in Jakarta, 13 in West Java, nine in Banten, three in East Java, three in the Special Region of Yogyakarta (DIY), and one in the Riau Islands.[98]
As of 4 September 2024, there were no known cases of Clade Ib mpox in Indonesia;[99] 11 cases that were previously suspected to belong to Clade Ib had all returned negative from further PCR tests.[100] Following the detection of multiple suspected cases across different points in Indonesia, including Bali and Jakarta, between August and September,[99] the Indonesian government decided to partially restore its past COVID-19 mitigation efforts,[101][102] including the use of the SATUSEHAT health pass for all travelers entering Indonesia.[101][103]
On 19 August 2024, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) announced that a 33-year-old male from Metro Manila, with no prior history of traveling overseas, had tested positive for mpox the day prior.[55][104] The patient was later determined to have contracted clade II mpox.[45]
On 9 September 2024, an mpox case was confirmed in New Zealand after attending the Winter Pride festival in Queenstown in August 2024.[105] On 11 September, a second mpox case was linked to the Queenstown Winter Pride festival.[106] By 20 September, a total of 11 cases of mpox were linked to the Winter Pride festival. The Queenstown outbreak included several cases of mpox clade II.[107][108]
Mpox is caused by the monkeypox virus. The virus is transmitted through close contact with infected animals or people,[109] including in-person communication and other kinds of physical contact,[110][111] contaminated bedsheets,[110] clothing or needles,[111] sexual contact,[109][110] and consumption of contaminated meat.[110][111]
In April 2024, researchers identified a novel subgroup of clade I of mpox in Kamituga, a mining town in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo.[3] Epidemiologists reported that the new variant—later named ""clade Ib""[110][111] or ""clade 1b""[111]—had the potential to spread with greater ease compared to other mpox strains.[3] The researchers theorized that the strain had undergone genetic mutations, allowing it to spread more easily through human transmission due to the mining town's remote location significantly limiting contact with animals that naturally carry and spread the disease.[3]
DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research reported that this marked ""a new phase of mpox"" from the prior outbreak in 2022 and 2023, since the new variant produced lesions predominantly on the genitals, making it more difficult to diagnose compared to strains that caused chest, feet, and hand lesions. It was thought that the new variant could have a higher likelihood of silent transmission due to its different manifestations.[3] The research team determined the detected form to be a Clade I type strain,[3] which historically has caused more severe symptoms in comparison to the Clade II type that was predominant during the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak.[3][111]
2024 genetic sequences of mpox from Republic of the Congo suggest that there are multiple co-circulating strains.[113]
In early January 2023, the New Zealand Government purchased 5,000 vials of mpox vaccines, enough for 20,000 people. A further shipment of vaccine vials was ordered for the later half of 2023. Individuals eligible for the mpox vaccine included close physical contacts of people with mpox including sexual partners and household contacts; gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with multiple partners, transgender and cisgender women who are in sexual relationships with these men; and those recommended to have the vaccine by medical specialists.[88]
Until June 2024, mpox vaccines were not approved by any African government, and the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts had not attested to the efficacy of vaccines. The director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, Michael J. Ryan, noted in an interview with NPR that the Democratic Republic of the Congo was simultaneously facing several other endemic diseases, including measles and cholera. Up to that point, only two labs in the DRC could perform polymerase chain reaction testing for mpox.[114]
Also in June 2024, authorities in the DRC had approved the vaccines MVA-BN (Jynneos) manufactured by Bavarian Nordic, and LC16, manufactured by KM Biologics, for emergency use.[115] Jynneos was later approved in Nigeria, also for emergency use.[116][117] Both countries officially started vaccination campaigns for mpox by the end of August of the same year.[118]
Also in August 2024, the chief executive officer of GAVI, Sania Nishtar, said the organization had already allocated up to $500 million as part of their ""First Response"" fund—which had originally been set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, mostly through donations by governments and global health funders, but was later kept in place to respond to new health emergencies.[4] However, Nishtar said that GAVI and UNICEF still had to wait for official requests from the countries affected by the outbreak, as well as definitive approval of mpox vaccines from the World Health Organization, to start ordering the doses and distributing them to affected nations.[4] In response, the WHO announced the launch of a process that would enable access to vaccines for emergency use in countries whose national approval was still pending.[116]
On 14 August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that the national government would donate 50,000 doses of the MVA-BN/Jynneos vaccine to the DRC.[116][119] The HHS also said that the U.S. had previously provided US$17 million to ""support clade I mpox preparedness and response efforts in Central and Eastern Africa"".[119]
On 16 August, Bavarian Nordic announced in a press statement that it had submitted clinical data to the European Medicines Agency to support the extension of the approval of MVA-BN/Jynneos to include adolescents aged 12 to 17 years;[117][120] the company cited as evidence the early results of a trial—sponsored by the NIH's National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)[120][121]—in 315 adolescents included in the aforementioned age range and 211 adults aged 18 to 50 years,[122] which showed that both the immune responses and the safety profile were similar between the two age groups after vaccination with two standard doses.[120][121][122] In the same statement, Bavarian Nordic also stated that a study of the vaccine in children aged 2 to 12 years would take place in the DRC and Uganda later in 2024.[120]
Also on 16 August, China's General Administration of Customs declared that national authorities would deploy screening measures for people and goods entering the country from areas affected by the outbreak for the following six months.[121][123] By 17 August, Pakistan had started screening travelers at all airports and at border crossings with surrounding countries.[124]
On 17 August, the Africa CDC announced that they had pledged to distribute 10 million doses of the mpox vaccine by 2025 and that Bavarian Nordic had agreed to enhance vaccine manufacturing capabilities across Africa,[118][125] to increase local supplies and reduce production costs.[118] The association's Director General, Jean Kaseya, later pleaded with foreign countries not to implement travel bans against African nations, as it had previously happened during the COVID-19 pandemic.[118]
On 19 August, the DRC's Minister of Public Health, Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba, said in a press conference that the DRC needed about 3.5 million doses of mpox vaccines, with roughly 215,000 doses set to be donated by Belgium and up to three million doses being donated by Japan, and further donations being expected by the United States.[74][75]
On 21 August, Germany's Federal Ministry of Health said that the federal government had previously accumulated 117,000 doses of the Jynneos vaccine, which had then been transferred to the Bundeswehr;[126][127] on 26 August, the German government publicly announced that it would donate 100,000 vaccines to the DRC and Burundi,[128] as well as other neighbouring African countries.[128][129] The government's spokesman, Steffen Hebestreit [de], also said that Germany would lend financial support both to the WHO and partners in Africa, in the latter case through the GAVI Vaccine Alliance,[129][130] while also collaborating with the African Union to enhance local vaccine production.[130]
On 28 August, the Africa CDC said that they had received roughly 10% of the estimated $245 million-fund they had requested to tackle the outbreak across the continent.[131][132]
On 4 September, Indonesia's Ministry of Health (Kemenkes) started implementing a preventive vaccination program, using the MVA-BN/Jynneos vaccine, which would prioritized regions that had reported Mpox cases, due to limited availability.[133]
On 5 September, a study published in the journal Cell showed that a new mRNA-based mpox vaccine, developed by Moderna, reportedly offered better protection in non-human primates than Bavarian Nordic's Jynneos vaccine.[134][135]
On 23 August 2024, the World Health Organization announced that partners like GAVI and UNICEF could start purchasing mpox vaccines before they received official approval from the agency, to expedite vaccine distribution across the African countries affected by the outbreak.[127] The WHO, which had already invited vaccine manufacturers to submit an Expression of Interest for Emergency Use Listing (EUL) of their products on 9 August,[136] was expected to grant an emergency license to the MVA-BN/Jynneos and LC16 vaccines in September 2024.[127][137] Writing for The New York Times, journalist Stephanie Nolen noted that the delayed approval of the mpox vaccines by the WHO—which she deemed as a ""Byzantine process""—would mainly affect the low-income and middle-income countries depending on the agency for the pre-qualification process for vaccines and treatments. At the same time, the U.S. FDA and the European Union's EMA had already issued emergency licenses for the same vaccines during the previous outbreak in 2022 and 2023.[137]
On 24 August, the United States was set to donate 10,000 mpox vaccines to Nigeria the following week; the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) said that it would also donate a further 50,000 doses to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, without specifying the arrival date, since Bavarian Nordic and the Congolese government were still discussing pre-shipment requirements for storage and handling of the vaccines.[138] Helen Rees, a member of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC)'s emergency committee for mpox, stated that the delay in granting Africa access to vaccines was ""really outrageous,"" as the continent had already experienced similar struggles during the COVID-19 vaccination programme.[138][139]
On 27 August, Nigeria's National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA) announced that the country had received 10,000 doses of the MVA-BN/Jynneos vaccine as a donation from the US,[140][141] making it the first African country to receive a batch since the start of the outbreak.[141] On the same day, Spain's Ministry of Health (MISAN) announced that they would donate 20% of their national supplies of mpox vaccines, roughly corresponding to 100,000 vials and 500,000 doses, to several countries in Central Africa;[142][143] the MISAN also urged the European Commission to extend the same proposal to every member country of the EU, stating that ""it makes no sense to accumulate vaccines [in countries] where the problem doesn't exist, and this is the time to prove it.""[142]
On 5 September, the DRC's Ministry of Public Health, Samuel Roger Kamba Mulamba, announced that the country had received their first batch of mpox vaccines, consisting in 99,000 doses of MVA-BN/Jynneos, and that a further delivery on 7 September would take the total amount to 200,000 doses; both batches were donated by the EU's Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA).[144][145] Vaccination programs subsequently were set to start in the state's most affected provinces in October and be handled by UNICEF,[145] as the doses were distributed between Kinshasa, Lubumbashi and Goma.[146] HERA's director, Laurent Muschel, said that the EU aimed to deliver at least 566,000 doses to the most affected countries in the region.[144] Africa CDC's Director General, Jean Kaseya, said that the association would distribute a further 3,600,000 doses to Gabon, Burundi, Central African Republic and Ivory Coast in the following weeks; he also stated that vaccine manufacturing would start in Africa from 2025, with an estimated 85-90% cost reduction.[146]
On 13 September, the WHO has granted prequalification status to the MVA-BN vaccine, manufactured by Bavarian Nordic, as the first vaccine approved for use against mpox. This vaccine, originally developed for use against smallpox, had previously only been available under an emergency use licence.[147] Its use is aimed at controlling the spread of the disease in African countries severely affected by recent outbreaks.[148] This approval, known as prequalification, comes as a new strain of the virus spreads from the Democratic Republic of Congo to neighboring nations.[149] The prequalification helps developing countries access the vaccine, as they often lack the resources to conduct thorough safety and efficacy tests. U.N. agencies also depend on this process before purchasing medical products.[150] Bavarian Nordic announced it could supply 13 million doses of its mpox vaccine by the end of 2025, with the potential to increase supply by an additional 50 million doses in 12–18 months, pending demand and regulatory approvals.[151] The company is exploring capacity expansion as the WHO declared mpox a global health emergency, but vaccine shortages have hindered containment efforts.[152]
On 25 September, Bavarian Nordic received a $63 million order from the U.S. government to produce additional bulk product and 1 million freeze-dried doses of its mpox and smallpox vaccine, Jynneos, to be delivered by 2026.[153] The bulk product will replenish inventory used during the 2022 mpox outbreak. The order comes after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time due to an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.",2196.0,17.291338582677167,0.06205513784461157,0.32793673577884097,15.25,753.0,5.929133858267717,32.97,16.0,16.8,13.59,19.1,8.6,13.6,63.53,14.0,318.68,2.2049180327868854,6.762750455373406,0.4093806921675774

Western Pacific; HQ:

A public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC FAYK) is a formal declaration by the World Health Organization (WHO) of ""an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response"", formulated when a situation arises that is ""serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected"", which ""carries implications for public health beyond the affected state's national border"" and ""may require immediate international action"".[1] Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.[2] The declaration is publicized by an IHR Emergency Committee (EC) of international experts,[3] which was developed following the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.[4]
Since 2005, there have been eight PHEIC declarations: the 2009–2010 H1N1 (or swine flu) pandemic, the ongoing 2014 polio declaration, the 2013–2016 outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa, the 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic,[5] the 2018–2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic,[6] the 2020–2023 declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic,[7] and the 2022–2023 and 2024 mpox outbreaks.[8][9] The recommendations are temporary and require reviews every three months.[1]
Automatically, SARS, smallpox, wild type poliomyelitis, and any new subtype of human influenza are considered as PHEICs and thus do not require an IHR decision to declare them as such.[10] A PHEIC is not only confined to infectious diseases, and may cover an emergency caused by exposure to a chemical agent or radioactive material.[11][12] It can be seen as an ""alarm system"", a ""call to action"", and ""last resort"" measure.[13][14]
Multiple surveillance and response systems exist worldwide for the early detection and effective response to contain the spread of disease. Time delays occur for two main reasons. The first is the delay between the first case and the confirmation of the outbreak by the healthcare system, allayed by good surveillance via data collection, evaluation, and organisation. The second is when there is a delay between the detection of the outbreak and widespread recognition and declaration of it as an international concern.[4] The declaration is promulgated by an emergency committee (EC) made up of international experts operating under the IHR (2005),[3] which was developed following the SARS outbreak of 2002–2003.[4] Between 2009 and 2016, there were four PHEIC declarations.[15] The fifth was the 2018–2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic, declared in July 2019 and ended in June 2020.[6] The sixth was the COVID-19 pandemic, declared in January 2020 and ended in May 2023.[16] The seventh was the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak, declared in July 2022 and ended in May 2023.[8] Under the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), states have a legal duty to respond promptly to a PHEIC.[2]
PHEIC is defined as:
an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other States through the international spread of disease and to potentially require a coordinated international response.[17]
This definition designates a public health crisis of potentially global reach and implies a situation that is ""serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected"", which may necessitate immediate international action.[17][18]
It can be seen as an ""alarm system"", a ""call to action"" and ""last resort"" measure.[13][14]
WHO Member States have 24 hours within which to report potential PHEIC events to the WHO.[10] It does not have to be a member state that reports a potential outbreak, hence reports to the WHO may also be received informally, by non-governmental sources.[19][20]
Under the IHR (2005), ways to detect, evaluate, notify, and report events were ascertained by all countries in order to avoid PHEICs. The response to public health risks also was decided.[13]
The IHR decision algorithm assists WHO Member States in deciding whether a potential PHEIC exists and whether the WHO should be notified. The WHO should be notified if any two of the four following questions are affirmed:[10]
The PHEIC criteria include a list of diseases that are always notifiable.[19] SARS, smallpox, wild type poliomyelitis, and any new subtype of human influenza are always a PHEIC and do not require an IHR decision to declare them as such.[17]
Large scale health emergencies that attract public attention do not necessarily fulfill the criteria to be a PHEIC.[13] ECs were not convened for the cholera outbreak in Haiti, chemical weapons use in Syria, or the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, for example.[12][21]
Further assessment is required for diseases that are prone to becoming pandemics, including, but not limited to cholera, pneumonic plague, yellow fever, and viral hemorrhagic fevers.[21]
A declaration of a PHEIC may appear as an economic burden to the state facing the epidemic. Incentives to declare an epidemic are lacking and the PHEIC may be seen as placing limitations on trade in countries that already are struggling.[13]
In order to declare a PHEIC, the WHO Director-General is required to take into account factors that include the risk to human health and international spread as well as advice from an international committee of experts, the IHR Emergency Committee (EC), one of whom should be an expert nominated by the State within whose region the event arises.[1] Rather than being a standing committee, the EC is created on an ad hoc basis.[22]
Until 2011, the names of IHR EC members were not publicly disclosed; in the wake of reforms, now they are. These members are selected according to the disease in question and the nature of the event. Names are taken from the IHR Experts Roster. The director-general takes the advice of the EC, following their technical assessment of the crisis using legal criteria and a predetermined algorithm after a review of all available data on the event. Upon declaration, the EC then makes recommendations on what actions the director-general and member states should take to address the crisis.[22] The recommendations are temporary and require review every three months while in place.[1]
Summary of PHEIC declarations
In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged. It was detected first in Mexico, North America. It spread quickly across the United States and the world.[23] On 26 April 2009,[24] more than one month after its first emergence,[4] the initial PHEIC was declared when the H1N1 (or swine flu) pandemic was still in phase three.[25][26][27] Within three hours on the same day, the WHO web site received almost two million visits, necessitating a dedicated web site for the swine influenza pandemic.[24] At the time that H1N1 had been declared a PHEIC, it had occurred in only three countries.[4] Therefore, it was argued that the declaration of the H1N1 outbreak as a PHEIC, was fueling public fear.[21] A 2013 study sponsored by the WHO estimated that, although similar in magnitude to seasonal influenza, it cost more life-years than seasonal flu, due to a shift toward mortality among persons less than 65 years of age.[28]
The second PHEIC was the 2014 polio declaration, issued on 5 May 2014 with a rise in cases of wild polio and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus.[11] The status achieved, as global eradication, was deemed to be at risk by air travel and border crossing overland, with small numbers of cases in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Nigeria.[21][11]
In October 2019, continuing cases of wild polio in Pakistan and Afghanistan, in addition to new vaccine-derived cases in Africa and Asia, was reviewed and polio continued to be a PHEIC.[29] As of November 2021, taking into account recent events in Afghanistan, a large number of unvaccinated children, increasing mobile people in Pakistan and the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among others, polio remains a PHEIC.[30]
Confirmed cases of Ebola were being reported in Guinea in December 2013 and Liberia in March 2014 and Sierra Leone by May 2014.[4][13] On 8 August 2014, following the occurrence of Ebola in the United States and Europe and with the already intense transmission ongoing in three other countries for months,[13] the WHO declared its third PHEIC in response to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa.[31] Later, one review showed that a direct impact of this epidemic on America escalated a PHEIC declaration.[4] It was the first PHEIC in a resource-poor setting.[13]
On 1 February 2016, the WHO declared its fourth PHEIC in response to clusters of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome in the Americas, which at the time were suspected to be associated with the ongoing 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic.[32] Later research and evidence bore out these concerns; in April, the WHO stated that ""there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome.""[33] This was the first time a PHEIC was declared for a mosquito‐borne disease.[21] This declaration was lifted on 18 November 2016.[34]
In October 2018 and then later in April 2019, the WHO did not consider the 2018–2020 Kivu Ebola epidemic to be a PHEIC.[35][36] The decision was controversial, with Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) responding with disappointment and describing the situation as ""an Ebola gas can sitting in DRC that's just waiting for a match to hit it"",[37] while the WHO panel were unanimous in their decision that declaring it a PHEIC would not give any added benefit.[37] The advice against declaring a PHEIC in October 2018 and April 2019, despite the criteria for doing so appearing to be met on both occasions, has led to the transparency of the IHR EC coming into question. The language used in the statements for the Kivu Ebola epidemic has been noted to be different. In October 2018, the EC stated ""a PHEIC should not be declared at this time"". In the 13 previously declined proposals for declaring a PHEIC, the resultant statements quoted ""the conditions for a PHEIC are not currently met"" and ""does not constitute a PHEIC"". In April 2019, they stated that ""there is no added benefit to declaring a PHEIC at this stage"", a notion that is not part of the PHEIC criteria laid down in the IHR.[22][38]
After confirmed cases of Ebola in neighbouring Uganda in June 2019, Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the WHO, announced that the third meeting of a group of experts would be held on 14 June 2019 to assess whether the Ebola spread had become a PHEIC.[39][40] The conclusion was that while the outbreak was a health emergency in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the region, it did not meet all the three criteria for a PHEIC.[41] Despite the number of deaths reaching 1,405 by 11 June 2019 and 1,440 by 17 June 2019, the reason for not declaring a PHEIC was that the overall risk of international spread was deemed to be low, and the risk of damaging the economy of the DRC high.[42] Adhanom also stated that declaring a PHEIC would be an inappropriate way to raise money for the epidemic.[43] Following a visit to the DRC in July 2019, Rory Stewart, the UK's DfID minister, called for the WHO to declare it an emergency.[44]
Acknowledging a high risk of spread to the capital of North Kivu, Goma, a call for a PHEIC declaration was published on 10 July 2019 in The Washington Post by Daniel Lucey and Ron Klain (the former United States Ebola response coordinator). Their declaration stated that ""in the absence of a trajectory toward extinguishing the outbreak, the opposite path—severe escalation—remains possible. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo—a city of 1 million residents with an international airport—or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. With a limited number of vaccine doses remaining, either would be a catastrophe"".[45][46] Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. Subsequently, the WHO announced a reconvening of a fourth EC meeting on 17 July 2019, when they officially announced it ""a regional emergency, and by no means a global threat"" and declared it as a PHEIC, without restrictions on trade or travel.[47][48] In response to the declaration, the president of the DRC, together with an expert committee led by a virologist, took responsibility for directly supervising action, while in protest of the declaration health minister Oly Ilunga Kalenga resigned.[49] A review of the PHEIC had been planned at a fifth meeting of the EC on 10 October 2019 [50] and on 18 October 2019 it remained a PHEIC[6] until 26 June 2020 when it was decided that the situation no longer constituted a PHEIC, as the outbreak was considered over.[51]
On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19, centered on Wuhan in central China, a PHEIC.[16][52] On 5 May 2023, the WHO ended the PHEIC declaration for COVID-19.[53]
On the date of the declaration, there were 7,818 cases confirmed globally, affecting 19 countries in five of the six WHO regions.[54][55] Previously, the WHO had held EC meetings on 22 and 23 January 2020 regarding the outbreak,[56][57][58] but it was determined at that time that it was too early to declare a PHEIC, given the lack of necessary data and the then-scale of global impact.[59][60]
The WHO recognized the spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.[61] The emergency committee convened its third meeting on 30 April 2020,[62] fourth on 31 July,[63] fifth on 29 October,[64] sixth on 14 January 2021,[65] seventh on 15 April 2021,[66] ninth in October 2021,[67] tenth in January 2022,[68] eleventh in April 2022,[69] twelfth in July 2022,[70] thirteenth in October 2022,[7] fourteenth in January 2023,[71] and fifteenth in May 2023.[53]
In September 2022, the Lancet commission on COVID-19 published a report, calling the response to the pandemic ""a massive global failure on multiple levels"".[72][73] The WHO responded by noting ""several key omissions and misinterpretations in the report, not least regarding the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) and the speed and scope of WHO's actions.""[72][74] They stated that the report ""offers the best opportunity to insist that the failures and lessons from the past 3 years are not wasted but are constructively used to build more resilient health systems and stronger political systems that support the health and wellbeing of people and planet during the 21st century.""[72]
The formal end of the COVID-19 PHEIC is a matter of much nuance which carries its own risks, and as of March 2023, ""WHO member states are negotiating amendments to the International Health Regulations as well as a new legally binding agreement (most likely a treaty) on pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response. Proposals include the possibility of issuing intermediate public health alerts (short of PHEICs) and determining public health emergencies of regional concern. Notably, although COVID-19 is routinely referred to as a pandemic, this word is not used in the International Health Regulations.""[75] With the emergency phase of the pandemic being regarded as having ended, more subtle and robust institutional responses and protocols are in the works for further iterations of this pandemic as well as global pandemics of whatever etiology.[76]
At the second IHR meeting for the 2022–2023 mpox outbreak on 21 July 2022, members of the emergency committee were divided about issuing a PHEIC, with six in favor and nine against.[77] On 23 July 2022, the WHO director-general declared the outbreak a PHEIC.[78] On 11 May 2023, the WHO ended the PHEIC declaration for Mpox, six days after doing so for COVID-19.[79]
On the date of the declaration, there were 17,186 cases reported globally, affecting 75 countries in all six WHO regions, with five deaths reported outside Africa and 72 deaths in African countries.[80] The WHO had previously held an EC meeting on 23 June 2022 regarding the outbreak, which had more than 2,100 cases in over 42 countries at that point; it did not reach the criteria for a PHEIC alert at the time.[81] It was re-classified a PHEIC in August 2024.[9]
After an IHR meeting on 14 August 2024, the WHO declared an mpox outbreak in parts of Africa, of a new variant of the disease, a PHEIC.[82] This marks the second time in three years that the WHO has classified an mpox outbreak as a global emergency.[83][84] As of 17 August 2024, over 15,600 cases and 537 deaths have been reported in the current outbreak, with approximately 96% of cases occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).[85] 12 other African countries, some for the first time, have also reported cases.[86]
In 2018, an examination of the first four declarations (2009–2016) showed that the WHO was noted to be more effective in responding to international health emergencies, and that the international system in dealing with these emergencies was ""robust"".[5]
Another review of the first four declarations, with the exception of wild polio, demonstrated that responses were varied. Severe outbreaks, or those that threatened larger numbers of people, did not receive a swift PHEIC declaration, and the study hypothesized that responses were quicker when American citizens were infected and when the emergencies did not coincide with holidays.[4]
PHEIC was not invoked with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2013.[88][89] Originating in Saudi Arabia, MERS reached more than 24 countries and resulted in 876 deaths by May 2020,[90][91] although most cases were in hospital settings rather than sustained community spread. As a result, what constitutes a PHEIC has been unclear.[12][90]
PHEIC are not confined to only infectious diseases or biological ones. It may cover events caused by chemical agents or radioactive materials.[12]
Debate exists regarding whether the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance may constitute a PHEIC.[92][93]

103,https://www.hs.mh.tum.de/en/trainingswissenschaft/news-en/article/lehrstuhl-fuer-epidemiologie-publiziert-aufsatz-im-journal-of-epidemiology-and-global-health/,"Sub-Saharan Africa is the region most affected by the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV for short, worldwide. HIV damages the body's own defenses, which is why the body can no longer fight off invading pathogens such as bacteria, fungi or viruses. This can lead to life-threatening illnesses such as severe pneumonia.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, young women and girls between the ages of 15 and 24 in particular are at up to three times the risk of infection than a man of the same age. Due to gender and other inequalities, violence, stigmatization, discrimination and ultra-conservative laws, women and girls are often unable to fully protect themselves against HIV. In particular, the low social status of women and girls is one of the main reasons for the rapid spread of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.
The Chair of Epidemiology headed by Prof. Dr. Stefanie Klug has conducted a study on the empowerment of women, which is an important factor in HIV prevention. For this reason, the connection between the empowerment of women and HIV-related indicators was investigated. The results were published under the title ""The Association of Women's Empowerment with HIV-Related Indicators: A Pooled Analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys in Sub-Saharan African"" in the ""Journal of Epidemiology and Global Health"". The journal has an impact factor of 7.3.
For the analysis, the latest demographic and health surveys were used, which include HIV tests in 31 countries in sub-Saharan Africa in addition to other biomarkers. Women's empowerment was measured using the Survey-based Women's EmPowerment (SWPER) index and compared with HIV-related indicators. These include HIV status, HIV testing (ever and in the last twelve months), condom use during last high-risk sex, ability to ask partner to use a condom, and ability to refuse sex.
""Young women are affected in four out of five new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa,"" explains Theresa Schierl, now a Research Associate at the Chair of Social Determinants of Health and first author of the publication. It is the result of a Master's thesis at the Center for Global Health of the TUM Faculty of Medicine in cooperation with the Chair of Epidemiology. ""We wanted to know why young women in particular are infected and what factors can contribute to this. For this reason, we used the SWPER index to analyze factors such as HIV status or condom use. This allowed us to reflect a holistic picture of women.""
In total, data from 208,947 women were included in the study, of which 100,924 (48%) were classified as ""highly empowered"" and 21,933 (10%) as ""lowly empowered"". In particular, women in South Africa (88%), Angola (82%), Ghana (78%), Namibia (76%) and Zimbabwe (74%) were highly empowered, while Chad (29%), Senegal (23%), Niger (21%), Burkina Faso (19%) and Mali (13%) had the lowest scores. On the one hand, women in urban (58%) compared to rural areas (46%) and women with a better education (79% compared to 36% without education) were more empowered.
However, no correlation was found between women's empowerment and their HIV status. Women with high empowerment were more likely to have ever been tested for HIV, but less likely to have been tested for HIV in the last twelve months. In addition, subjects with a high level of empowerment were more likely to ask their partner to use a condom and refuse sex.
""We were able to determine that the empowerment of women does not appear to be related to HIV status, but is closely linked to a woman's ability to make decisions about her sexual behavior,"" Prof. Klug summarizes the results and also highlights the importance of the study: ""The empowerment of women and young girls can contribute to achieving the United Nations' goal of eliminating HIV/AIDS as a health threat by 2030. However, according to the UN, this requires in particular the consideration of scientific findings. It also requires strong political leadership, the fight against inequalities and sustainable financing.""

104,https://5minuteenglish.com/the-importance-of-english-in-global-health-initiatives/,"English is often termed the global language and for good reason. In the sphere of global health initiatives, the importance of English cannot be overstated. From international conferences to on-the-ground medical assistance in far-flung regions, English acts as the common medium of communication. The language barrier can be a significant hurdle in rolling out health programs, disseminating critical information, and ensuring effective collaboration among professionals from different countries.
Global health initiatives are concerted efforts to tackle health issues that affect populations across the world. Diseases know no borders, and neither should the efforts to combat them. Whether it’s dealing with pandemics like COVID-19, addressing chronic diseases, or managing mental health, the scope is invariably international. With a lingua franca, such as English, these initiatives can be made more cohesive and effective.
For non-native English speakers, particularly those in the medical field or participating in health initiatives, possessing a basic command of English is often not just beneficial but necessary. This article elucidates how mastering basic English skills can substantially contribute to the success of global health initiatives, emphasizing why English should be a priority in health education and training programs worldwide.
One of the most straightforward yet crucial aspects of global health initiatives is effective communication. Health professionals, scientists, and policymakers from different countries need to communicate fluently, and English serves as the bridge. From sharing research findings to developing strategies and protocols, a common language ensures there is no loss in translation, which can lead to potentially severe misunderstandings.
Furthermore, collaboration among international teams is often a linchpin for the success of health initiatives. Different countries bring unique perspectives, resources, and expertise to the table, and English facilitates these contributions. Imagine a scenario where medical practitioners from various countries need to share patient data or treatment methodologies. A common linguistic background helps in swiftly and accurately exchanging crucial information.
Not only does English proficiency enhance collaboration among professionals, but it also bridges the gap between communities and healthcare providers. For instance, local healthcare workers who can communicate in English can better interpret guidelines provided by international health committees, ensuring localized and effective implementation of health programs.
Access to the most recent and credible medical research is invaluable in managing health challenges. A majority of this information is published in English, making it essential for health professionals to have at least a basic understanding of the language. The top medical journals, research papers, and groundbreaking studies are predominantly written in English, meaning non-English speakers could miss out on vital knowledge if they aren’t proficient in the language.
Additionally, online courses, webinars, and health information portals primarily utilize English, further emphasizing the necessity for English literacy. Whether it’s staying updated on the latest cancer treatments or understanding new public health policies, the ability to comprehend English extends one’s access to a wealth of information that might otherwise be inaccessible.
In emergencies, such as during the outbreak of a disease, rapid dissemination of information is critical. Guidelines, preventive measures, and treatment options are initially published in English by organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Proficiency in English ensures quicker response times and better-preparedness among global health workers.
For individuals involved in global health initiatives, professional development is often intertwined with their ability to master English. Attending international conferences, seminars, and workshops is a crucial part of continuing education for health professionals. These events frequently use English as the primary medium of communication, and those who lack proficiency may find themselves at a disadvantage.
Many of the acclaimed medical and public health programs are conducted in English, making the language a prerequisite for enrolment. Institutions such as the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine attract students from around the world, and proficiency in English is a must to take full advantage of these learning opportunities.
Moreover, networking is a key aspect of professional development; being able to communicate in English allows professionals to forge important connections, share knowledge, and engage in meaningful collaborations. These relationships can lead to further learning, better job opportunities, and the sharing of best practices, ultimately enriching global health efforts.
Effective patient care is not just about the medical treatment provided but also about the education delivered to the patients and their families. In multinational settings, especially in regions visited by foreign aid workers, English often acts as the medium of instruction. Having at least a basic command of English enables healthcare providers to educate patients more effectively regarding their treatments, medications, and lifestyle changes.
When dealing with patients from diverse backgrounds, language barriers can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunication, which can adversely affect patient care. By speaking a common language, healthcare providers can ensure that their patients are fully aware of their health conditions and the necessary steps for managing them.
Additionally, English proficiency among local health workers allows them to better interpret and translate educational materials provided by international health organizations. This ensures that the critical health messages reach the local population accurately and in a manner that is culturally sensitive and easily comprehensible.
Enhancing English skills within communities can lead to a ripple effect of positive outcomes in global health initiatives. Educated community members who are proficient in English can act as intermediaries, helping to bridge the gap between international health workers and local populations. They can translate medical guidelines, interpret studies, and ensure that the community is fully engaged in health initiatives.
These intermediaries can also advocate for community needs more effectively in international forums, ensuring that the unique challenges faced by their communities are understood and addressed accordingly. When communities are empowered with the knowledge and the means to communicate their needs and experiences, the design and implementation of health programs can be significantly more effective and tailored to local contexts.
Furthermore, teaching English to young people in communities can prepare them for futures in global health professions. Encouraging the younger generation to learn English not only broadens their career prospects but also builds a workforce that is well-prepared to engage in global health initiatives, thereby sustaining these efforts long-term.
The impact of English proficiency on global health initiatives is profound and multifaceted. From improving communication and collaboration to ensuring access to crucial information, the benefits ripple through every aspect of global health efforts. This common language enables healthcare professionals to work together more effectively, ensures patients receive accurate and understandable care, and empowers communities to take an active role in their health.
For non-native English speakers involved in global health, developing basic English skills is an investment that can pay significant dividends. As global health challenges become increasingly complex, the importance of a shared language in facilitating effective and efficient responses cannot be overlooked. English, in this context, is not just a tool for communication but a critical underpinning that supports the entire framework of global health initiatives.
By prioritizing English language skills, health professionals and organizers can enhance their capacity to contribute to global health. This not only improves individual professional development but also leads to collective progress in tackling some of the world’s most pressing health challenges. Ultimately, in the quest for a healthier global community, English serves as a vital key that unlocks the potential for cooperation, learning, and innovation across borders.",755.0,13.017241379310345,0.10840586718246294,0.3364804964539006,14.6,312.0,5.379310344827586,16.22,16.2,16.5,17.87,18.2,9.21,10.571428571428571,64.55,17.0,110.95,2.537748344370861,7.940397350993377,0.5589403973509933

Os choques em cascata que assolaram o mundo nos últimos anos revelam-se intratáveis. A guerra e o conflito, a política polarizada, uma crise contínua do custo de vida e os impactos cada vez maiores de um clima em mudança teimam em desestabilizar a ordem global.
As principais conclusões do Relatório de Riscos Globais de 2024 do Fórum Económico Mundial refletem estes desafios mais prementes enfrentados pela população global. O relatório revela um mundo “atormentado por uma dupla de crises perigosas: climática e conflito”. Estas ameaças surgem num contexto de rápida aceleração da mudança tecnológica e da incerteza económica.
As conclusões baseiam-se na Pesquisa de Percepção de Riscos Globais do Fórum, que reúne insights de quase 1.500 especialistas globais do meio acadêmico, empresarial, governamental, da comunidade internacional e da sociedade civil.
Embora os riscos relacionados ao clima continuem a ser um tema dominante, a ameaça da desinformação e da desinformação é identificada como a ameaça mais grave a curto prazo no relatório de 2024.
Disinformation and climate-related risks will dominate global threats for years to come. Image: Global Risks Report 2024, World Economic Forum
A crescente preocupação com a desinformação e a desinformação é em grande parte motivada pelo potencial da inteligência artificial (IA), nas mãos de maus intervenientes, para inundar os sistemas de informação globais com narrativas falsas.
Nos próximos dois anos, afirma o relatório, “tanto os intervenientes estrangeiros como os nacionais aproveitarão a desinformação e a desinformação para ampliar as divisões sociais e políticas”. Este risco é reforçado por um grande número de eleições num futuro próximo, com mais de 3 bilhões de pessoas indo às urnas em 2024 e 2025, incluindo grandes economias como os Estados Unidos, a Índia e o Reino Unido.
O relatório sugere que a propagação da informação incorrecta e da desinformação em todo o mundo poderá resultar em agitação civil, mas também poderá conduzir à censura imposta pelo governo, à propaganda interna e ao controlo do livre fluxo de informação.
Num contexto de 10 anos, os riscos relacionados com o clima contribuem para 5 das 10 principais ameaças à medida que o mundo se aproxima ou ultrapassa os “pontos de inflexão climáticos”.
The cost-of-living, cyberattacks and polarization of views also pose significant risks in the near-term. Image: Global Risks Report 2024, World Economic Forum
O risco representado por eventos climáticos extremos está no topo da lista, já que as nações permanecem despreparadas para o “desencadeamento de mudanças de longo prazo, potencialmente irreversíveis e autoperpetuantes, em sistemas planetários selecionados [que] poderiam ser ultrapassados em ou antes de 1,5°C de aquecimento global, atualmente previsto para ser alcançado no início da década de 2030”.

106,https://www.who.int/news/item/06-05-2025-working-together-to-make-asthma-a-global-health-priority,"To mark World Asthma Day 2025, the  Global Asthma Network (GAN) launches the Global Asthma Report 2025: Patient Stories, a compelling collection of stories from people living with asthma around the world. The report shines a spotlight on the daily challenges individuals face – from delayed diagnoses to unaffordable or unavailable inhaled medicines – as well as the life-changing benefits of timely and effective treatment.
More than 250 million people worldwide are living with asthma – a significant global health burden. This year’s World Asthma Day theme, “Make inhaled treatments accessible for all,” reinforces the urgency of ensuring universal access to affordable, quality-assured asthma medicines. Despite decades of evidence showing that inhaled treatments — including bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids — reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent deaths, access remains inadequate in many low- and middle-income countries.
Asthma inhalers are included in the  WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, are core medicines in the  WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease (NCD) interventions for primary health care, and are included in the WHO “Best Buys” for NCDs.
The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) is launching a campaign to raise awareness of these  gaps and is calling on Heads of State and global health leaders to invest in solutions that make inhaled treatments available to everyone who needs them.
The upcoming fourth United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs, to be held in September 2025, offers a pivotal moment for Heads of State and Government, UN partners, Ministers of Health, civil society and donors to strengthen existing commitments to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one third by 2030.
“By prioritizing equitable access to medicines and strengthening primary healthcare systems, countries can not only meet global NCD targets but also enjoy significant economic and social returns,” said José Luis Castro, WHO Director General’s Special Envoy for Chronic Respiratory Diseases. “Improved asthma care leads to better health outcomes, enhanced education performance, and increased participation in the labour market.”
WHO continues to lead global efforts to address chronic respiratory diseases.  Through its Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), WHO works with partners such as FIRS, GAN and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), to strengthen global advocacy and technical support for countries.
“The work of our longstanding, valued partners is vital,” said Dr Sarah Rylance, technical lead for chronic respiratory diseases at WHO. “Together, we are amplifying critical evidence-based messages and driving progress to ensure that every person with asthma – no matter where they live – can breathe freely.”
WHO is currently updating the guidance on the diagnosis and management of asthma in primary care. Up-to-date, evidence-based global recommendations are essential to support countries to prioritise effective asthma treatment within their national health system planning and policy development.",286.0,20.428571428571427,0.18371101687428218,0.3359815354713314,17.55,96.0,6.857142857142857,17.57,17.8,17.6,16.08,20.4,10.68,16.5,66.83,18.0,38.94,2.2937062937062938,7.129370629370629,0.7482517482517482

At an interactive side event during the 24th Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), Indigenous leaders, health experts and advocates gathered to explore the guiding principles and priority areas for actions that will shape the Global Plan of Action (GPA) for the health of Indigenous Peoples. Co-hosted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Permanent Mission of Brazil, the event marked a step in advancing World Health Assembly Resolution 76.16, which calls for stronger rights-based action to address health disparities faced by Indigenous Peoples worldwide. Moderated by Geoffrey Roth (Lakota, Standing Rock and Member of the UNPFII), speakers and participants at the event emphasized that the GPA must be developed with Indigenous Peoples, not for them, and must reflect Indigenous conceptualizations of health, considering self-determination, culturally grounded healing systems and ancestral knowledge.
A major theme of the event was the need for Indigenous leadership to guide the design, implementation and monitoring of the Global Plan, with speakers emphasizing that Indigenous Peoples, including those at the grassroots level, must be meaningfully involved. “Access means a meaningful and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples, including in this WHO global action plan,” said Binota Moy Dhamai, member of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (EMRIP). “Their right to self-determination, protection of their land and territory, recognition of knowledge systems on traditional medicine, and Indigenous-led governance are crucial for maintaining Indigenous Peoples' health.” Some concerns were raised about access to global mechanisms, which are often not user friendly and can exclude entire communities of people. Many highlighted the urgent need for Indigenous Peoples to be included in key discussions.
Discussions also emphasized that Indigenous Peoples’ full conceptualizations of health, including the holistic connection rooted in balance with the land, spirit and communities, must be central to the GPA. “As an Indigenous woman, I don’t speak about myself first but about my land, my place, my ancestors,” said Emma Rawson Te-Patu, President of the World Federation of Public Health Associations. Such a holistic conceptualization includes addressing mental health concerns in ways that are community-informed and safeguard Indigenous medicinal knowledge and practices. It also involves the protection and promotion of traditional medicine systems as a whole; the safeguarding of Indigenous lands and languages; and the centring and embedding of ancestral knowledge into universal health coverage (UHC) and climate resilience strategies. Health systems must acknowledge not only individuals but also their ancestors, lands and communities as essential sources of healing and knowledge.
Speakers called for practical collaboration across UN agencies and international frameworks to avoid fragmentation. WHO was urged to coordinate closely with related initiatives on biodiversity, traditional medicine and knowledge, climate change and desertification. WHO’s Global Traditional Medicine Centre was identified as an important mechanism to support the delivery of the Global Plan.
Another strong recommendation was the establishment of a high-level Indigenous advisory body to guide and oversee the Plan’s development and implementation. Such a body would safeguard and promote human rights-based approaches to health, informed consent and sustainable Indigenous-led community funding mechanisms in implementing and monitoring the GPA.
This event marked a clear call to move beyond dialogue and toward broader and sustained accountable partnerships that centre Indigenous voices in shaping their own health and well-being. It also emphasized the need for global and country health strategies to honour Indigenous knowledge and resilience. As Geoffrey Roth noted in his opening remarks, “We have the wisdom.

The findings, based on rapid WHO assessment of the fast-evolving situation, raise concern for potentially deeper and prolonged effects on health systems and services across the world, especially in vulnerable and fragile settings. This requires urgent action and international response.
The new rapid stock take conducted in March–April 2025 with 108 WHO country offices, primarily in low- and lower-middle-income countries, shows that many countries are working to increase or reallocate funding from domestic and alternative external sources to address gaps. However, up to 24% of WHO Country Office responses suggest budget cuts are already translating into increased out-of-pocket payments. The poor and vulnerable likely risk bearing the additional brunt of these impacts.
“These results paint a worrying picture about the impact of the sudden and unplanned cuts to aid on the health of millions of people,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Although these cuts are a shock, they are also driving an accelerated transition away from aid dependency to a more sustainable self-reliance, based on domestic resources. Many countries are asking for WHO’s support, and WHO is working with them to identify and tailor the most effective measures.”
The stock take reports provide an early snapshot and insights from WHO country offices that work closely with ministries of health, providing regular support on health systems policies and planning. The stock take aimed at identifying the urgent support countries need to avoid catastrophic impacts on the health of the populations and to guide monitoring of the rapidly evolving situation.
Key findings from the stock take show the following.
Given the rapidly evolving context, WHO will be monitoring the situation over time and will engage the global health community, including partners and donor agencies, to inform urgent response plans to mitigate deepening country impacts and enable greater sustainability.
Note to editors:
These findings represent a snapshot of the health systems and health services situation in the context of a rapidly evolving situation. Senior WHO country office staff were surveyed over the period of 7 March to 2 April 2025 to provide inputs and observations on the impact of ODA suspensions and reductions through a structured survey. WHO country offices in low- and lower-middle-income countries across all six WHO regions were included in this survey. They do not reflect the official views of the governments in the countries, territories and areas. WHO has a global presence in 150+ locations putting central focus on countries and populations, working to protect and improve the health of everyone, everywhere.

The United States spent roughly US$12 billion on global health in 2024. Without that yearly spending, roughly 25 million people could die in the next 15 years, according to models that have estimated the impact of such cuts on programmes for tuberculosis, HIV, family planning and maternal and child health.
The United States has long been the largest donor for health initiatives in poor countries, accounting for almost one-quarter of all global health assistance from donors. These investments have contributed to consistent public-health gains for more than a decade. HIV deaths, for example, dropped by 51% globally between 2010 and 2023, and deaths owing to tuberculosis dropped by 23% between 2015 and 2023.
But the administration of US President Donald Trump has cut billions of dollars of spending for global health, including dismantling the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and freezing foreign-aid contributions — some of which has been temporarily restored.
Researchers have been trying to study the potential impact of the funding cuts. John Stover, an infectious-diseases modeller at Avenir Health, a global-health organization in Glastonbury, Connecticut, and his colleagues used mathematical models to estimate health outcomes, should all US funding for global health be cut and not replaced, compared with outcomes if funding provided in 2024 were to continue through to 2040. The results were posted on the preprint server SSRN earlier this month and have not been peer reviewed1.

The researchers “use a combination of robust, well-established and proven mathematical models and analytical approaches to estimate the impact”, says Andrew Vallely, a clinical epidemiologist at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. “Their findings are devastating to read” and “a wake-up call for all of us working in global health.”
James Trauer, an infectious-disease modeller at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, adds: “These models are probably as good as we have available at the moment for predicting the direct effects of the funding cuts on these various programmes.”
On 28 March, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, said that the government was reorienting its foreign-assistance programmes to align with the country’s priorities. “We are continuing essential life-saving programmes and making strategic investments that strengthen our partners and our own country.”
The researchers modelled the impact of cutting the US President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) in the 55 countries it supports, including stopping the delivery of treatments, tests and interventions that prevent transmission. The programme has been affected by funding freezes.
Without PEPFAR, there would be 15 million more deaths from AIDS by 2040 than if the programme continued (see ‘A world without US aid’). More than 60% of those deaths would take place in six African countries, including Mozambique, Nigeria and Uganda. Roughly 14 million extra children would become orphans as a result of those AIDS deaths — a trend that had been expected to decrease over the next 15 years. And 26 million more people could become infected with HIV without PEPFAR.

The impact varies considerably depending on how reliant a country is on US government support, says Stover. In Uganda, for example, 65% of funding for HIV research comes from the United States, he says. Some models estimated the effects of a partial-funding scenario; in this case, continuing funding for treatment alone could avert 97% of the extra deaths and 90% of the extra new HIV infections.
The global number of infections of Mycobacterium tuberculosis — the bacterium that causes the world’s deadliest infectious disease — is also expected to ramp up without US aid funding. Researchers looked at the impact of cuts to USAID and US contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria across 79 low- and middle-income countries — although it is not yet clear by how much US contributions to the fund will shrink in the coming years. These would contribute to 69 million more M. tuberculosis infections and 2 million more deaths by 2040.
These estimates are broadly consistent with other efforts to assess the impact, says Trauer.
“There’s been tremendous progress made in global health over the last couple of decades and we’re at risk of losing a lot of that,” says Katherine Horton, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who contributed to the modelling on tuberculosis.",402.0,15.461538461538462,0.06420110192837467,0.3215289256198347,14.46,123.0,4.730769230769231,37.94,14.1,15.0,13.41,16.5,9.65,16.0,56.79,15.0,59.05,2.181592039800995,6.840796019900497,0.6467661691542289

Unless NCDs are urgently addressed, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved. In recognition of the enormous challenges NCDs pose to all countries, the  Fourth High-level Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases will be convened in 2025. The aim will be to accelerate the global response to the prevention and control of NCDs by strengthening health systems and reorienting them towards primary health care and to meet the SDGs by 2030.
Nearly 1.8 billion adults worldwide are at risk of developing serious diseases such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers as a result of insufficient physical activity, according to new data. Collective efforts based on partnerships between government and nongovernmental stakeholders and increased investments in innovative approaches will be needed to reach the least active people and to reduce inequalities in access to measures that promote and improve physical activity.
WHO's Global status report on alcohol and health and treatment of substance use disorders highlighted that there were 2.6 million deaths from alcohol and 0.6 million from drug use in 2019, alongside significant societal impacts of alcohol consumption, including injuries, violence, and increased risks of chronic and infectious diseases. The report sets out the actions urgently needed to reduce substance use and expand treatment through prevention, improved systems of care, and advocacy.
The first-ever global drowning status report was published in 2024, showing a 38% decrease in deaths from drowning worldwide since the year 2000 – a major achievement in global health.
Neurological conditions are now the leading cause of illness and disability worldwide, with more than 1 in 3 people affected by these conditions (such as migraine, stroke and dementia). New data highlight the impact of growing inequality in access to treatment, with more than 80% of neurological deaths and loss of health occurring in low- and middle-income countries.
Hunger remains a serious problem worldwide. A new report,  The state of food security and nutrition in the world 2024, contains the latest information on hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition. Major drivers of food insecurity and malnutrition continue to be conflict, climate variability, and economic slowdowns and downturns.

116,https://www.who.int/news/item/06-05-2025-working-together-to-make-asthma-a-global-health-priority,"To mark World Asthma Day 2025, the  Global Asthma Network (GAN) launches the Global Asthma Report 2025: Patient Stories, a compelling collection of stories from people living with asthma around the world. The report shines a spotlight on the daily challenges individuals face – from delayed diagnoses to unaffordable or unavailable inhaled medicines – as well as the life-changing benefits of timely and effective treatment.
More than 250 million people worldwide are living with asthma – a significant global health burden. This year’s World Asthma Day theme, “Make inhaled treatments accessible for all,” reinforces the urgency of ensuring universal access to affordable, quality-assured asthma medicines. Despite decades of evidence showing that inhaled treatments — including bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids — reduce symptoms, improve quality of life, and prevent deaths, access remains inadequate in many low- and middle-income countries.
Asthma inhalers are included in the  WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, are core medicines in the  WHO package of essential noncommunicable disease (NCD) interventions for primary health care, and are included in the WHO “Best Buys” for NCDs.
The Forum of International Respiratory Societies (FIRS) is launching a campaign to raise awareness of these  gaps and is calling on Heads of State and global health leaders to invest in solutions that make inhaled treatments available to everyone who needs them.
The upcoming fourth United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs, to be held in September 2025, offers a pivotal moment for Heads of State and Government, UN partners, Ministers of Health, civil society and donors to strengthen existing commitments to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one third by 2030.
“By prioritizing equitable access to medicines and strengthening primary healthcare systems, countries can not only meet global NCD targets but also enjoy significant economic and social returns,” said José Luis Castro, WHO Director General’s Special Envoy for Chronic Respiratory Diseases. “Improved asthma care leads to better health outcomes, enhanced education performance, and increased participation in the labour market.”
WHO continues to lead global efforts to address chronic respiratory diseases.  Through its Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases (GARD), WHO works with partners such as FIRS, GAN and the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), to strengthen global advocacy and technical support for countries.
“The work of our longstanding, valued partners is vital,” said Dr Sarah Rylance, technical lead for chronic respiratory diseases at WHO. “Together, we are amplifying critical evidence-based messages and driving progress to ensure that every person with asthma – no matter where they live – can breathe freely.”
WHO is currently updating the guidance on the diagnosis and management of asthma in primary care. Up-to-date, evidence-based global recommendations are essential to support countries to prioritise effective asthma treatment within their national health system planning and policy development.",286.0,20.428571428571427,0.18371101687428218,0.3359815354713314,17.55,96.0,6.857142857142857,17.57,17.8,17.6,16.08,20.4,10.68,16.5,66.83,18.0,38.94,2.2937062937062938,7.129370629370629,0.7482517482517482
